was only by retrospect you could be made aware of the amazing variety of ideas that had been presented mr clare certainly found few men in this remote situation that were capable of participating in his ideas and amusements it has been among the weaknesses of great men to fly to solitude and converse with woods and groves rather than with a circle of strong and comprehensive minds like their own from the moment of mr falkland s arrival in the neighbourhood mr clare distinguished him in the most flattering manner to so penetrating a genius there was no need of long experience and patient observation to discover the merits and defects of any character that presented itself the materials of his judgment had long since been accumulated and at the close of so illustrious a life he might almost be said to see through nature at a glance what wonder that he took some interest in a mind in a certain degree congenial with his own but to mr tyrrel s diseased imagination every distinction bestowed on his neighbour seemed to be expressly intended as an insult to him on the other hand mr clare though gentle and benevolent in his remonstrances to a degree that made the taking offence impossible was by no means parsimonious of praise or slow to make use of the deference that was paid him for the purpose of procuring justice to merit it happened at one of those public meetings at which mr falkland and mr tyrrel were present that the conversation in one of the most numerous sets into which the company was broken turned upon the poetical talents of the former a lady who was present and was distinguished for the acuteness of her understanding said she had been favoured with a sight of a poem he had just written entitled an ode to the genius of chivalry which appeared to her of exquisite merit the curiosity of the company was immediately excited and the lady added she had a copy in her pocket which was much at their service provided its being thus produced would not be disagreeable to the author the whole circle immediately entreated mr falkland to comply with their wishes and mr clare who was one of the company enforced their petition nothing gave this gentleman so much pleasure as to have an opportunity of witnessing and doing justice to the exhibition of intellectual excellence mr falkland had no false modesty or affectation and therefore readily yielded his consent mr tyrrel accidentally sat at the extremity of this circle it cannot be supposed that the turn the conversation had taken was by any means agreeable to him he appeared to wish to withdraw himself but there seemed to be some unknown power that as it were by enchantment retained him in his place and made him consent to drink to the dregs the bitter potion which envy had prepared for him the poem was read to the rest of the company by mr clare whose elocution was scarcely inferior to his other accomplishments simplicity discrimination and energy constantly attended him in the act of reading and it is not easy to conceive a more refined delight than fell to the lot of those who had the good fortune to be his auditors the beauties of mr falkland s poem were accordingly exhibited with every advantage the successive passions of the author were communicated to the hearer what was impetuous and what was solemn were delivered with a responsive feeling and a flowing and unlaboured tone the pictures conjured up by the creative fancy of the poet were placed full to view at one time overwhelming the soul with superstitious awe and at another transporting it with luxuriant beauty the character of the hearers upon this occasion has already been described they were for the most part plain unlettered and of little refinement poetry in general they read when read at all from the mere force of imitation and with few sensations of pleasure but this poem had a peculiar vein of glowing inspiration this very poem would probably have been seen by many of them with little effect but the accents of mr clare carried it home to the heart he ended and as the countenances of his auditors had before sympathised with the passions of the composition so now they emulated each other in declaring their approbation their sensations were of a sort to which they were little accustomed one spoke and another followed by a sort of uncontrollable impulse and the rude and broken manner of their commendations rendered them the more singular and remarkable but what was least to be endured was the behaviour of mr clare he returned the manuscript to the lady from whom he had received it and then addressing mr falkland said with emphasis and animation ha this is as it should be it is of the right stamp i have seen too many hard essays strained from the labour of a pedant and pastoral ditties distressed in lack of a meaning they are such as you sir that we want do not forget however that the muse was not given to add refinements to idleness but for the highest and most invaluable purposes act up to the magnitude of your destiny a moment after mr clare quitted his seat and with mr falkland and two or three more withdrew as soon as they were gone mr tyrrel edged further into the circle he had sat silent so long that he seemed ready to burst with gall and indignation mighty pretty verses said he half talking to himself and not addressing any particular person why ay the verses are well enough damnation i should like to know what a ship load of such stuff is good for why surely said the lady who had introduced mr falkland s ode on the present occasion you must allow that poetry is an
he immediately penetrated the cause and observed that my very countenance told him he was no longer a welcome guest to me i asked him if he ought so to be since his motives for seeking admission were unworthy of being communicated to my friends that he said was not the case but that prudence in the present instance required a temporary concealment he then undertook to exculpate himself from blame assuring me that as soon as i should discountenance the expectations of mr boyer and discontinue the reception of his address his intentions should be made known he was enlarging upon this topic when we heard a footstep approaching us and looking up saw mr boyer within a few paces of the arbor confusion seized us both we rose involuntarily from our seats but were mute as statues he spoke not a word but casting a look of indignant accusation at me a glance which penetrated my very soul turned on his heel and walked hastily back to the house i stood a few moments considering what course to take though shame and regret had almost taken from me the power of thought major sanford took my hand i withdrew it from him i must leave you said i where will you go said he i will go and try to retrieve my character it has suffered greatly by this fatal interview he threw himself at my feet and exclaimed leave me not eliza i conjure you not to leave me let me go now i rejoined or i bid you farewell forever i flew precipitately by him and went into the parlor where i found mr boyer and my mamma the one traversing the room in the greatest agitation the other in a flood of tears their appearance affected me and i wept like an infant when i had a little recovered myself i begged him to sit down he answered no i then told him that however unjustifiable my conduct might appear perhaps i might explain it to his satisfaction if he would hear me that my motives were innocent though they doubtless wore the aspect of criminality in his view he sternly replied that no palliation could avail that my motives were sufficiently notorious he accused me of treating him ill of rendering him the dupe of coquetting artifice of having an intrigue with major sanford and declared his determination to leave me forever as unworthy of his regard and incapable of love gratitude or honor there was too much reason in support of his accusations for me to gainsay them had his impetuosity suffered me to attempt it but in truth i had no inclination to self defence my natural vivacity had forsaken me and i listened without interrupting him to the fluency of reproachful language which his resentment inspired he took a very solemn and affectionate leave of my mamma thanking her for her politeness and wishing her much future felicity he attempted to address me i suppose somewhat in the same way but his sensibility somewhat overcame him and he only took my hand and bowing in silence departed the want of rest for two long nights together the exercise of mind and conflict of passions which now tortured my breast were too much for me to support when i saw that he was gone that he had actually forsaken me i fainted my mamma with the assistance of the maid soon restored me when i opened my eyes and beheld this amiable and tender parent watching and attending me with the most anxious concern without one reproachful word without one accusing look my reflections upon the part i had acted in defeating her benevolent wishes were exquisitely afflictive but we mutually forbore to mention the occasion of my illness and i complied with her advice to take some refreshment and retire to my chamber i am so much fatigued by the exertions of the day that rest is absolutely necessary and i lay aside my pen to seek it friday morning when i shall again receive the balmy influence of sleep i know not it has absolutely forsaken me at present i have had a most restless night every awakening idea presented itself to my imagination whether i had sustained a real loss in mr boyer s departure reflections on my own misconduct with the censure of my friends and the ill natured remarks of my enemies excited the most painful anxiety in my mind i am going down but how shall i see my mamma to her i will confess my faults in her maternal breast repose my cares and by her friendly advice regulate my conduct had i done this before i might have escaped this trouble and saved both her and myself many distressing emotions friday evening i have had a long conversation with my mamma which has greatly relieved my mind she has soothed me with the most endearing tenderness mr atkins with whom mr boyer lodged while in town called here this afternoon i did not see him but he told my mamma that mr boyer had returned home and left a letter for me which he had promised to convey with his own hand by this i am convinced that the die is absolutely cast with respect to him and that no attempts on my part to bring about a reconciliation would be either prudent or successful he has penetrated the cause of my proceedings and such is his resentment that i am inclined not much to regret his avoiding another interview my excuses would be deemed utterly insufficient and truth would not befriend and justify me as i know you are impatient to hear from me i will now despatch this long letter without any other addition than that i am your sincere friend eliza wharton letter xlii to mr charles deighton hartford well charles the show is over as we yankees say and the
time to be visible only by fits this token of approaching land affected me as much as if i had reached the threshhold of my friend s dwelling at length we entered the port and i viewed with high raised but inexplicable feelings objects with which i had been from infancy familiar the flag staff erected on the battery recalled to my imagination the pleasures of the evening and morning walks which i had taken on that spot with the lost constantia the dream was fondly cherished that the figure which i saw loitering along the terrace was her s on disembarking i gazed at every female passenger in hope that it was she whom i sought an absence of three years had obliterated from my memory none of the images which attended me on my departure chapter xxiv after a night of repose rather than of sleep i began the search after my friend i went to the house which the dudleys formerly inhabited and which had been the asylum of my infancy it was now occupied by strangers by whom no account could be given of its former tenants i obtained directions to the owner of the house he was equally unable to satisfy my curiosity the purchase had been made at a public sale and terms had been settled not with dudley but with the sheriff it is needless to say that the history of craig s imposture and its consequences were confirmed by every one who resided at that period in new york the dudleys were well remembered and their disappearance immediately after their fall had been generally noticed but whither they had retired was a problem which no one was able to solve this evasion was strange by what motives the dudleys were induced to change their ancient abode could be vaguely guessed my friend s grandfather was a native of the west indies descendants of the same stock still resided in tobago they might be affluent and to them it was possible that mr dudley in this change of fortune had betaken himself for relief this was a mournful expedient since it would raise a barrier between my friend and myself scarcely to be surmounted constantia s mother was stolen by mr dudley from a convent at amiens there were no affinities therefore to draw them to france her grandmother was a native of baltimore of a family of some note by name ridgeley this family might still exist and have either afforded an asylum to the dudleys or at least be apprised of their destiny it was obvious to conclude that they no longer existed within the precincts of new york a journey to baltimore was the next expedient this journey was made in the depth of winter and by the speediest conveyance i made no more than a day s sojourn in philadelphia the epidemic by which that city had been lately ravaged i had not heard of till my arrival in america its devastations were then painted to my fancy in the most formidable colours a few months only had elapsed since its extinction and i expected to see numerous marks of misery and dispopulation to my no small surprize however no vestiges of this calamity were to be discerned all houses were open all streets thronged and all faces thoughtless or busy the arts and the amusements of life seemed as sedulously cultivated as ever little did i then think what had been and what at that moment was the condition of my friend i stopt for the sake of respite from fatigue and did not therefore pass much time in the streets perhaps had i walked seasonably abroad we might have encountered each other and thus have saved ourselves from a thousand anxieties at baltimore i made myself known without the formality of introduction to the ridgeleys they acknowledged their relationship to mr dudley but professed absolute ignorance of his fate indirect intercourse only had been maintained formerly by dudley with his mother s kindred they had heard of his misfortune a twelvemonth after it happened but what measures had been subsequently pursued their kinsman had not thought proper to inform them the failure of this expedient almost bereft me of hope neither my own imagination nor the ridgeleys could suggest any new mode by which my purpose was likely to be accomplished to leave america without obtaining the end of my visit could not be thought of without agony and yet the continuance of my stay promised me no relief from my uncertainties on this theme i ruminated without ceasing i recalled every conversation and incident of former times and sought in them a clue by which my present conjectures might be guided one night immersed alone in my chamber my thoughts were thus employed my train of meditation was on this occasion new from the review of particulars from which no satisfaction had hitherto been gained i passed to a vague and comprehensive retrospect mr dudley s early life his profession of a painter his zeal in this pursuit and his reluctance to quit it were remembered would he not revert to this profession when other means of subsistence were gone it is true similar obstacles with those which had formerly occasioned his resort to a different path existed at present and no painter of his name was to be found in philadelphia baltimore or new york but would it not occur to him that the patronage denied to his skill by the frugal and unpolished habits of his countrymen might with more probability of success be sought from the opulence and luxury of london nay had he not once affirmed in my hearing that if he ever were reduced to poverty this was the method he would pursue this conjecture was too bewitching to be easily dismissed every new reflection augmented its force i was suddenly raised by it from the deepest melancholy to the region
taken it for a knob on the bark of the tree all three now returned to watch the manoeuvres of the birds that not having seen them by the nest still continued playing among the flowers the boys stole as near as possible keeping behind a large bunch of hanging vines lucien was nearest and his face was within a few feet of the little creatures so that he could observe every motion they made he was soon gratified with a sight that determined his point for him a swarm of small blue winged flies attracted his attention they were among the blossoms sometimes resting upon them and sometimes flitting about from one to another he saw the birds several times dash at them with open bills and pick them from their perch so the question was decided the humming birds were insect eaters after a while the female flew off to her nest leaving the male still among the flowers the curiosity of the boys was now satisfied and they were about to return to the tent when lucien suddenly made a motion whispering the others to remain silent francois first caught sight of the object which had caused this behaviour on the part of his brother and then basil saw it a hideous object it was crouching among the leaves now crawling sideways now making short springs and then hiding itself went a fearful looking creature it was about the size of one of the birds but far different in appearance its body consisted of two pieces joined about the middle and covered all over with a reddish brown wool or hair that stood upright like bristles it had ten limbs long crooked and covered with hair like the body two curved claw like antennae or feelers in front and two horns projecting behind so that but for the sharp fiery eyes of the creature it would have been difficult to tell its head from its hinder part its rusty colour its ill shaped body and hairy legs combined with the piercing look from its eyes gave it a most vicious appearance such as belongs less or more to all of its race for it was of the race aranea or spiders the leaping tarantula whispered lucien to his brothers see he continued it is after the ruby throat this was evident step by step and leap after leap it was approaching the cluster of blossoms where the humming bird was at the moment engaged its eyes were bent eagerly upon the latter and whenever it flew up from the flowers and whirred idly about the tarantula squatted itself closely hiding behind the leaves or shanks of the vines on the other hand when the bird settled a moment and appeared busily feeding the skulking creature would advance a stage nearer either by a quick run or a leap when it would again conceal itself and await a fresh opportunity as the bird flitted about a good deal the spider had frequently to change its direction in following the former after one of its short flights settled into a pet flower directly in front of where the latter lay crouching it did not enter the cup of the flower but remained at the mouth poised upon its whirring wings while with its long prehensile tongue it drew out the honey it had scarcely been a moment in this position when the tarantula sprang forward and clutched it round the body with his antennae the bird with a wild chirrup like that of a distressed cricket flew outward and upwards its wings were still free and all expected it would carry off the spider that was now seen clinging around it not so however on getting a few feet from the flower its flight appeared to be suddenly checked and although it still kept in the air flying first one way and then another it was evident that something restrained it from getting clear off on looking more attentively a fine silk like line was seen stretching from the trees to the fluttering creature it was the thread of the spider and this it was that prevented his victim from carrying him into the air the little wings soon ceased to move and both bird and spider fell to the end of the thread where they hung for a moment suspended the boys could see that the bird was dead and the mandibles of the tarantula were buried in its shining threat francois would have rushed forward to kill the destroyer but lucien who was too ardent a naturalist to have his lesson thus interrupted restrained his more impetuous brother and all three remained quiet as before the tarantula now commenced reeling in his line for the purpose of carrying his prey up among the branches where he had his nest the boys looked upward to discover the latter there sure enough was the web in a shaded corner stretching its meshes from a large liana to the trunk of the tupelo and towards this point the spider now slowly progressed with his lifeless victim as they watched his motions their eyes were caught by a shining object that moved along the wrinkled bark of the liana as the vine was nearly a foot in diameter and of a deep ferruginous colour this object was the more apparent against its dark ground for it was a creature of brilliant hues it was an animal of the lizard species and if any lizard could be considered beautiful this one might have been so called but the hideous half human form of these animals their piercing looks their stealthy and predatory habits and above all the knowledge that the bite of several of their species is poisonous combine to render them objects that excite disgust and awe rather than admiration this one as we have already said was of the most brilliant colour the whole of its upper surface was a
mr sheldon laughed at first at the whim she had conceived and endeavoured to rally her out of it but finding that it was to her a matter of serious importance and thinking there could be neither harm nor impropriety in granting her request he acceded to her wishes and she was ever after called dorcasina about two years after this a circumstance happened which formed an important era in the life of miss dorcasina mr sheldon one day received a letter from an old esteemed friend in virginia whom he had not seen for fifteen years informing him of his intention of making him a visit adding that he should bring with him his only son the stay and prop of his declining age and the darling of his fondest affections lysander by which name we shall cull the young gentlemen was about twenty five his person was noble and commanding his countenance open and liberal and his address manly and pleasing his understanding was rather solid than brilliant and much improved by education and travel his ideas of domestic happiness were just and rational and he judged from what he had observed that an agreeable matrimonial connexion was much the happiest state in life he therefore wished to marry but there happened to be no lady in the circle of his acquaintance who perfectly both satisfied his judgment and pleased his fancy miss dorcasina on perusing the letter handed by her father thought the time wag now come when she should experience the sweet satisfaction of loving and being loved the similarity of their circumstances lysander am only son and she an only daughter the old gentleman s coming so far to see her father his never having done it before and his bringing his son with him all served to confirm her in the opinion that he was the person decreed by the stars to become her husband she would to be sure have been better pleased had their acquaintance commenced in a more romantic manner she wished that in passing by his carriage had broken down and he had been brought in wounded or that he had accidentally met her scouring the woods on horseback an amusement in which she took great delight and that her horse being unruly he had arrived just in time to save her from falling or which would have been still more to her taste that some resolute fellow in love with her to distraction but who had made no impression on her heart had carried her off by force to marry her and that lysander had rescued her by his gallantry and conveyed her back in safety to the arms of her distressed parent but as none of these romantic adventures with which she had been so delighted in novels had ever happened to her she thought she must be satisfied if at their first interview he beheld her with raptures of delight and of this she entertained not a shadow of doubt the night previous to the day on which with alternate emotions of hope fear and pleasure she expected the arrival of lysander she returned at her usual hour to her chamber attended by a female domestic who having been brought up in the family from seven years old had become her confidante and favourite this she considered indispensible for it would have been entirely out of character and setting aside a most essential circumstance in the life of a heroine not to have had either a friend to whom she could confide the secret of her love or a maid who could be bribed by an enamorato to place a letter in her way and then confidentially assert that she knew not from whence it came both these characters are frequently united in the same person as was the case in the present instance for there being no female among her acquaintance in the neighbourhood whose notions of love were so refined or if you please so romantic as were those of miss dorcnsina she declined all intimacy with them and preferred betty to the double capacity of servant and confidante betty was a few years older than her mistress she was a good hearted honest creature possessed of a tolerably good natural understanding but very ignorant and extremely superstitious after dorcasina had disposed herself in bed she requested betty to sit down by her bedside saying she had something of consequence to communicate betty having seated herself in an attentive posture dorcasiha began by informing her that it was impressed on her mind that she and the young gentleman who was next day expected should at first sight fall violently in love with each other and that she had not the least doubt but he was the person destined by heaven to become her husband betty remaining silent for indeed she was at a loss for a reply dorcasina thus continued though i know that love is stronger than death and that with a beloved object a person may be happy on the top of the alleganies or among the snows of greenland yet i must confess i shall feel a sensible pain at quitting my dear and affectionate father and this delightful spot where i have passed all my life and to which i feel the strongest attachment but what gives me the greatest pain is that i shall be obliged to live in virginia he served by slaves arid be supported by the sweat toil and blood of that unfortunate and miserable part of mankind perhaps ma am said betty lysander and his father treat their slaves well and they live comfortable and happy comfortable they may be replied dorcasina but slavery and happiness are in my opinion totally incompatible disguise thyself as thou wilt still slavery thou art a bitter pill they complain of the idle thievish unfaithful disposition of their slaves but let the proprietors in their turn be degraded to servitude

his loquacious conductor entertained him on the road with a description of his peggy and her family and leander though he smiled at his simplicity could not but admire his disinterested generosity and warm benevolence these were qualities of the heart and under whatever form they were exhibited were worthy of admiration the carriage at length stopped at the door of the cottage leander s heart bounded with expectation as he stepped over the threshold in a moment he found himself in the presence of his amelia they rushed to each other s arms and those who have felt the keen rapture of a safe return can only imagine the feelings of two fond hearts glowing with undivided affection amelia soon recollected herself and rapidly withdrew her hand what dow this mean exclaimed he oh my amelia when

cheered her desponding spirits by representing in lively colours the joy of her parents on seeing her return we must pass over in silence the scene of their interview parental and filial affection

impetuosity of a torrent might indeed be overwhelmed but not rent asunder three days intervened and the lovers had no interview in the hour of misfortune when oppressed with a multiplicity of thoughts to disburthen the mind either by writing or conversation gives relief to pain and transquillity to the unquiet borne down with sorrowing reflections ira took the determination of communicating his thoughts to isabella the unfortunate bride was sitting heavy melancholy musing twas at the decline of day the parting sun shot a horizontal beam through the crimson curtains ira entered and beheld in the person of his beloved the figure of patience on a monument as described by shakespeare smiling at grief he took her hand she looked up arose my husband my brother the young man agitated by a thousand sensations grew gradually composed isabella i must see you no more how are my senses bewildered in this meeting i find even now that to meet your eye is at once my pleasure and my perdition why do i suppress my feelings why check the tears which involuntarily burst from my eyes peace ira peace give liberty to your sensations to act themselves why dam up the streams of thy tears are they not the characteristicks of nature to designate an honest heart to remain in your presence my sister my wife is willingly to swim into the vortex of destruction i have imposed upon myself a resolve therefore to see you no more convinced that absence from you will conduce to my welfare isabella manifested evident symptoms of dislike at this resolution will you fly and suffer me to sink into the gulf of despair for never more shall i appear in the world if uncomforted uncountenanced unsupported by you no matter by what title i call you still are you my stay and my staff the young husband imagined he proceeded systematically let us be ruled by reason in all distress mankind imbibe consolation from two sources in dissipation is sought a temporary forgetfulness but experience evinces there is no lethe for love in time or absence we trust for relief but how vain the hope of future repose i will strike a blow at the root i will depart with all imaginable expedition i will seek redress in the bosom of the mercantile world busied with novelty and engaged in regular pursuits i will teach my mind to contemplate other objects and to forget the image of isabella which has so long possest my heart and obtruded itself into every action of my life perhaps my future conduct may be tinged with the melancholy of this adventure i will yet remember you with respect what is more with tenderness a new era is commenced in the history of my life i am no more what i was hitherto i have conceived of human nature a character which it is a duty to wear now i read them as they are and feel myself a better man a better citizen though less philanthropick regarding myself i shall be rich and be capacitated to fulfil those offices of tenderness and charity which i have heretofore only known in theory for one favourable circumstance i pay my gratitude to the bounty of heaven the discovery and termination of an unfortunate passion has not sunk me to that stupid apathy which absorbs the senses but has inspired me with that resolution which is the soul of action doomed to look on you only in the light and to call you only by the appellation of sister reminded by every object of the calamitous event of our loves i go lorenzo in the ardour of friendship provides my passage and i am forthwith to embark isabella viewed the project of her friend with pity and a smile which indicated her contempt of its practicability your forced pretended resolution my dear ira is of little consequence i know your character ira better than you know it yourself honest sincere impetuous yet meek and candid i can conceive how far you may be driven by the strength of passion how far deluded by the well intended but wrong headed advice of friendship do you love and yet think to forget one by mixing with the world of business impossible personal presence is not necessary to inspire or continue love we love those whom we have never seen or from whom we are removed by absence the characters of the great and the good picture to us ideas of beauty and beauty is the cause of love how are we struck with the awful virtue of a brutus or a cato how delighted with the more gentle more amiable graces of a scipio how do we exult in the honest heart and unambitious mind of a cincinnatus a la fayette and a washington to come up to our times still nearer how are our breasts warmed with sympathetick benevolence at the name of howard do we not figure to ourselves in the solemnity of sacred anticipation the son of heaven seated at the right of the throne of grace extending the hand of welcome to the disciple of charity and pronouncing with the voice of applause i was in prison and you came unto me we love those whom we have not seen because we entertain in our hearts an idea of beauty caused by their virtues surely therefore if you are possessed of such an idea it will follow you to the uttermost parts of the earth haunted continually with the ideal presence of the beloved object you will change your climate but not your mind remembering me is the retrospect painful matters it in what place you take this retrospect better be here though surrounded with disappointment and solemn thought than among strangers let the mind be employed but do not go ira perceived in the argument of isabella that sublime which not only persuades but transports he owned
a word not used by any english prose writer of eminence until the reign of george the third nor ever introduced into a serious poem until adopted by cowper a word which if we may judge of adjectives as we do of men by their associates shows the baseness of its origin by the company it keeps being generally coupled with fellow a term i conceive of no respect except in courts and colleges englishmen from the peer to the peasant cannot converse ten minutes without introducing this pert adjunct the english do not however use it in the same sense we do in new england where we apply it to personal grace and call a trim well built young man clever which signification is sanctioned by bailey s and the elder english dictionaries nor do they use it in our secondary sense when applying it to the qualities of the mind we intend by it good humoured they use it to signify skilful adroit and the man who breaks a dwelling house a prison or a neck adroitly is clever i heard a reverend prebend in company with several clergymen of the episcopal church after having magnified the genius of the prelate pronounce the archbishop of canterbury a very clever fellow a native of england may be distinguished as readily by the frequent use of the adjective clever as the native of new england by that of the verb guess it was not until i had been some months in london that i discovered how often i exposed myself to ridicule by the repeated use of this verb my new friend b of the inner temple who has a profound knowledge of every subject but the law as he is one of those assiduous benchers described by pope who pens a sonnet when he should engross pointed out to me this provincialism as he styled it what is the reason he inquired that you new englandmen are always guessing i replied coolly because we imagine it makes us appear very clever fellows now here to my astonishment b was in the same predicament as myself although he had repeated clever and clever fellow perhaps twenty times in this interview he had not noticed it he was a gentleman of too refined a taste to advocate this alsatia term but would hardly be persuaded of its exuberant use until i had drawn his attention to it in conversation with several of his countrymen and was at length obliged to send him half a sheet of extracts in prose and verse to convince him of its absurd recurrence in the modern english fine writing but b is really a clever fellow learned and candid terms seldom united by a london copula and we agreed to assist each other in devesting our style of these silly colloquisms soon after b said to me with earnestness now you have read boswell you must acknowledge dr johnson to have been a very clever fellow i guess he was i replied if however i should be requested to note some shibboleth to distinguish an old from a new englandman it would not belike the israelites in pronunciation nor yet in expression or accent not in words but in mode an englishman puts and answers a question directly a new englandman puts his questions circuitously and ways answers a question by asking another i am indebted in some measure to b for this distinction who in early life spent a winter in hartford connecticut but which your own observations even in boston will abundantly confirm when my friend the templar first noticed this local peculiarity i was inclined to dispute its universality among us b offered to risk the decision of our dispute upon the reply of the first new englandman we should chance to accost and as an englishman who is opposed to you in argument always has abet or a blow at your service he offered a small wager that he would propose a direct question to him and the yankey should reply by asking another we were strolling in st james s park and who should approach very opportunely butcharles of salem after the first salutations b said pray mr what time of the day is it by your watch why i ca nt say what o clock is it by yours this was followed by a hearty laugh but when the affair was explained to charles he insisted it was merely fortuitous and might not happen again in a thousand instances and finally when b in the pride of victory offered to double the bet and repeat the experiment he took him up b said select your man but here comes your countryman dr you will allow him to be as correct a speaker as any in new england all shall be fair i will put the question in such a way as shall preclude the possibility of his being taken by surprise charles acknowledged dr was the very man he would have selected the doctor by this time joined our party pray doctor said b very deliberately what is the reason you new englandmen always reply to a question by asking another why is that the case sir as you are a very clever fellow and i guess you are wearied by this time i will conclude my letter lest you should not be in a humour to say that s a good one letter xxxiii literary larceny forgery and swindling chatterton ireland and macpherson london my excellent friend in our simple country whenever you hear theft or forgery mentioned you are immediately impressed with the idea of some low fellow stealing a horse or with burroughs issuing his canada bank bills but here in this sublime metropolis where every virtue and every vice is carried to a refined extreme are rogues found who can steal the cardinal virtues and forge counterfeit immortality horace might boast that his name was too
delivered a package of letters to my uncle from my father the carriage with one servant the driver had returned from the chesapeak to connecticut my father had but one brother and two sisters of which my uncle here is the youngest one of my aunts the old maid who was my protectress at the old mansion you have seen at my father s the other was the mother of alfred she married very young to a gentleman in hartford of the name of wilmot who fell before the walls of louisburg in the old french war my aunt did not long survive him her health which had been for some time declining received so serious a shock by this catastrophe that she died a few months after the melancholy tidings arrived leaving alfred their only child then an infant to the protection of his relations who as soon as he arrived at a suitable age placed him at school my grandfather who had the principal management of mr wilmot s estate sent my uncle who was then young and unmarried to hartford for the purpose of transacting the necessary business here he became acquainted with a young lady eminent for beauty and loveliness but without fortune the daughter of a poor mechanic as soon as my grandfather was informed of this attachment he in a very peremptory manner ordered my uncle to break off the connection on pain of his highest displeasure but such is the force of early impressions melissa sighed that my uncle found it impossible to submit to these firm injunctions a clandestine marriage ensued and my grandfather s maledictions in consequence the union was however soon dissolved my uncle s wife died in about twelve months after their marriage and soon after the birth of the first child which was a daughter inconsolable and comfortless my uncle put the child out to nurse and travelled to the south after wandering about for some time he took up his residence in charleston where he amassed a splendid fortune he finally married to an amiable and respectable woman whose tenderness though it did not entirely remove yet greatly alleviated the pangs of early sorrow and this added to the little blandishments of a young family fixed him in a state of more contentedness than he once ever expected to see his daughter by his first wife when she became of proper age was sent to a respectable boarding school in boston where she remained until within about two years before i came here alfred was educated at harvard college as soon as he had graduated he came here on my uncle s request and has since remained in his family soon after i arrived here my uncle came into my chamber one day melissa said he i find by your father s letters that he considers you to have formed an improper connection i wish you to give me a true statement of the matter and if any thing can be done to reconcile you to your father you may depend upon my assistance i have seen some troubles in this way myself in my early days perhaps my counsel may be of some service i immediately gave a correct account of every particular circumstance from the time of my first acquaintance with you until my arrival at this house he sat some time silent and then told me that my father he believed had drawn the worst side of the picture and that he had urged him to exert every means in his power to reclaim me to obedience that beauman was to follow me in a few months and that if i still refused to yield him my hand my father positively and solemnly declared that he would discard me forever and strenuously enjoined it upon him to do the same i well know my brother s temper continued my uncle the case is difficult but something must be done i will immediately write to your father desiring him not to proceed too rashly in the mean time we must consider what measures to pursue you must not my niece you must not be sacrificed so saying he left me highly consoled that instead of a tyrant i had found a friend in my new protector alfred was made acquainted with the affair and many were the plans projected for my benefit and abandoned as indefeasible till an event happened which called forth all the fortitude of my uncle to support it and operated in the end to free me from persecution my uncle s daughter by his first wife was of a very delicate and sickly constitution and her health evidently decreasing after she came to this place she was sent to a village on one of the high hills of pedee where she remained a considerable time she then went to one of the inland towns in north carolina from whence she had but just returned with alfred when i arrived afterwards i accompanied her to georgetown and other places attended by her father so that she was little more known in charleston than myself but all answered no purpose to the restoration of her health a confirmed hectic carried her off in the bloom of youth i was but a few months older than she her name was melissa a name which a pious grandmother had borne and was therefore retained in the family our similarity of age and in some measure of appearance our being so little known in charleston and our names being the same suggested to alfred the idea of imposing on my father by passing off my cousin s death as my own this would at least deter beauman from prosecuting his intended journey to charleston it would also give time for farther deliberation and might so operate on my father s feelings as to soften that obduracy of temper which deeply disquieted himself and others and thus
with a man who had given her such evident proofs of indifference and selfishness but i tremble for her she knows not the world into which she is about to plunge open sincere and without disguise herself she suspects not deceit in others this is a disposition most liable to imposition of any in the world and where joined to great sensibility is the source of undescribable anguish to the possessor i have made some particular inquiries concerning this mrs bellamy with whom sarah is about to embark for an another kingdom i cannot reconcile the idea to myself that a tract of ocean will divide us that in distress or sickness i cannot fly to her that contrary winds may detain her letters even should she write on all occasions but even this she will not promise i will inform you of my health said she but i shall not plague you with all the little cross incidents which may occur while i am acting in my double capacity of humble toad eater to grandmamma and madam governante to little darling you flattered me in your last with the hope of my seeing you in london it will i assure you be a very high gratification but as you mention january for the time of your proposed visit i fear sarah will long ere that have been the inhabitant of our sister island for some weeks as she thinks of departing the latter end of october anne letter xx sarah to anne london jan a most delectable voyage and journey i have had bad weather bad accommodations in the packet bad roads and bad tempered folks to deal with now is not this a bad beginning well there is an old adage which says a good beginning often makes a bad ending and why not vice versa we were six days crossing the channel the wind blew tempestuously and two or three times i thought we should have been obliged to revisit the coast of wales whether we chose it or not and that not in the pleasantest manner imaginable however here we are all difficulties of wind and weather over quietly set down in a very respectable lodging in one of the most public streets in dublin this mrs bellamy is a very different woman on this side st george s channel to what she was on the other and to deal plainly had i known as much before i left england as i do now i should never have thrown myself on her protection but as i am here i will remain a few months i have no great prediliction for another voyage though ever so short during the season when the winds let loose lash the mad billows until they foam and rise threatening even heaven itself indeed my dear there is no scene that ever i witnessed before to be compared to the sublimely terrific grandeur of a storm at sea the horizon contracted by the black impending clouds the angry scud flitting with rapidity through the sky the liquid mountains rising to the topmast heads and from their summit pouring with tremendous roar the white torrent that as it falls threatens to whelm in its abyss the fragile bark as the gloom of night approaches to see on the leeward quarter the black coast o er hung with precipices and fenced around with rocks over which the rude surge incessant breaks to hear the wind howl through the rigging of the laboring vessel which scarce can bear the smallest spread of sail then to reflect that perhaps before the morn returns the vessel crew all all may be enshrouded in a watery tomb no one can have an idea of the sensation that must at such a period prevade the mind even of the most thoughtless unless they have themselves been present at such a scene and to me it seems an impossibility that any one who had once been in such a situation could ever disbelieve the existence of a god great wise powerful and merciful who that has once contemplated his wisdom and his power on the world of waters would wish to disbelieve or for one single moment encourage a doubt but i beg your pardon anne that after having got you safe to dublin i have hurried you back to make you pass a stormy night at sea with a dangerous coast on your lee but as you have escaped shipwreck you may even come quietly again to dublin and setting down by my elbow in a little room up two pair of stairs which is but superior to a closet in a very small degree the furniture of which consists of a half tester bed a deal table a small iron grate that will hold a handful of fire and two rush bottom chairs now is not the apartment most elegant come sit down and be quiet and i will tell you all about madam bellamy and her fair daughter madam o donnel and her sweet pretty peevish petulant perverse grand daughter miss caroline o donnel the old dame does not want ideas in her head nor language to express those ideas but she is one of the most changeable capricious beings that nature ever formed her manners have been formed upon the scale of high life and she certainly has in early days sacrificed to the graces for even now she can converse with condescending affability every word accompanied by a fassinating smile she can be cheerful even to volability persuasion will hang upon her tongue and the genius of taste wit and elegance preside in her apartment but see her two hours after you will not know her for the same woman her brow will lour her large black eyes will flash malignity the demon of spite and slander take possession of her tongue and her language will be such as almost the lowest female would blush
should sternly insist that the work has none of the three great requisites a beginning a middle and an end the author has obligingly fixed the beginning at the first page and the end at the last leaving every one to place the middle where it best suits him or the learned critic may make a beginning by reading only a few pages and an end by frowning the whole work at once into oblivion whereby two out of the three requisites will certainly be produced in short the learned author in imitation of high authorities solicits the indulgence of the public with regard to the appearance of our common uncle sam although he is old enough to be very whimsical he is like the author a green character on the stage he will occasionally make his appearance on various parts of it bouncing like a sturgeon sinking out of sight and soon after thundering out at a distant part now if any one should be so impertinent as to enquire how he travelled some of our novel readers would be the most proper persons to solve the difficulty it will be ob served that another hand besides the professed author s has fingered occasionally in the work this with the discerning will form no objection of this character will be the next chapter the learned ancestors of mine uncle zachary are well known to the hebrew public and although the author at first resolved to have no mosaic work in the splendid structure yet it occurred to him that variety ever has its attractions and it is well known that stanhold and hopkin s translated psalms in company having said this the author submits himself to the acutely censorious allowing them to use the birchen rod whenever they can find him chapter ii some account of thomas the magician and it came to pass fell out or happened somewhat before the time at which our history begins that there arose a mighty man in the land called thomas the magician on account of his great skill and cunning in dark and mysterious projects this man when in his full strength was a mighty man of valor and withal very tender hearted insomuch that in the first notable quarrel between john bull and uncle sam he betook himself to a huge cavern lest his great strength and valor might do overmuch violence to his enemies here he studied magic necromancy and all the curious arts that serve to make a man great in the eyes of the multitude this thomas was moreover of a religious turn of mind for whereas uncle sam acknowledged only one god thomas professed to believe in twenty or none as occasion required whence it came to pass that the multitude for the space of many years cried out great is thomas the magician and it fell out that in process of time thomas fixed his eye on the chief steward ship for thus he reasoned with himself behold now the multitude of the people crieth after me and although george who is now chief steward is greatly beloved by the people yet he now governeth the household of samuel by a new covenant unto which divers of them have not willingly consented therefore i will listen diligently and whensoever t hear a murmuring will say unto the people would it not have been better thus behold did i not forewarn thee and so it came to pass that he began to take the servants by the hand and say unto them o that i were made judge in the land that any man having a matter should come to me and i would do him justice nevertheless the people were not minded to hearken to him for this time so that john became chief steward yet during the stewardship of john which was fifty and two moons thomas ceased not to vex the understanding of the multitude and to cause them to find much fault with the conduct of john and the wife of samuel and caused many grievous and sore complaints to be brought against them behold said thomas how mine uncle samuel hath fought in times past against john bull and hath prevailed nevertheless he oweth at this time many talents of silver yet john ceaseth not to build ships and to have bowmen and spearmen not a few and to lay many grievous burthens on the people and crieth out the philistines when no enemy is near and the whole land is in peace and see ye not this woman in whom the heart of mine uncle samuel is bound up how she walketh in the pride of her imagination and hath bought many costly ornaments of silk and of purple and delighteth in hoods and ear rings and bracelets and nose jewels and saith i sit a queen moreover she whispereth in secret and backbiteth and mocketh at all who walk not in her ways and approve not of her evil doings and thus did thomas stir up the minds of the people against john and they waxed wroth against john and they thrust him out of the stewardship and said unto thomas reign thou over us and unto samuel they said the counsel of this woman is not good for she wasteth thy substance lo now put her away and take unto thee the damsel which thomas hath provided for he hath proved her so samuel hearkened unto the people and put away his wife and the thing grieved george sore howbeit he put her away and took the damsel even the woman which thomas had appointed and he went in unto her and she became his wife now thomas had instructed her aforetime and said whenever it shall come to pass that thou shalt rule in the house of samuel whatsoever i shall bid you to do that shalt thou do without gainsaying and she said i will moreover
endangers that is an enemy not to me but to my country not your enemy major asked fleming in a tone of surprize no sir i never had an enemy i lost a hand not in fighting for myself but in defending my country though my sword has tasted blood my feelings and passions had no agency in the act i felt that i was engaged in a duty similar to that in which we are engaged in fighting and subduing our internal spiritual enemies our evil propensities which we are commanded to overcome and destroy though dearer to us than life for as we do the one for the welfare and happiness of the country which protects us so we perform the other for the promotion and extension of our redeemer s kingdom and our share of felicity in each is always proportionate to the uses we perform for both a very strange discrimination and most singular comparison was fleming s remark pray friend enquired brown to what religious sect dost thou belong willoughby again smiled to none sir in religion as in politics i know but one party i am a christian and know of no name under heaven by which man can be saved but that of jesus christ our creator and redeemer but this is again flying from the subject said fleming you say sir that you are an american so are we all by birth or adoption but which of the two administrations do you prefer the federal or republican mr fleming you must consider the question of considerable importance by the earnestness with which you urge it but i consider it of no importance whatever the last fifteen years of my life has been passed in a wilderness i have taken no part in the various questions of policy which have arisen in that period from the loop holes of retreat i have indeed occasionally peeped at mankind and like the poet whose expression i use have sighed for their follies and crimes i have seen two great political parties by turns possess the ascendency and hold the reins of government i entirely approve of neither i have found much to commend but still more to condemn in the measures of both self love and the love of dominion have in my opinion influenced them all and this will continue to be the case until human nature is renovated a singular politician exclaimed fleming as he rose to depart but we will renew the subject at another time mr brown i shall expect you to tea a still more singular christian said the quaker with a smile pray tell me friend how dost thou reconcile the doctrines of christ for whom thou appearest to have a great reverence with thy notions of patriotism and military duties my dear sir replied willoughby there is not a man on earth even the most zealous of your sect that is more fully convinced than i am that all the wars which have ever desolated this fair globe of earth have originated from men s lusts which war in the members the lust of the flesh the lust of the eye and the pride of life are the fuel which evil spirits by blasts from hell too often kindle to an infernal blaze in the hearts of the children of men how then canst thou conscientiously engage in them why sir in my opinion answered the major the true merits of the question must rest upon this point is it lawful to resist the unjust aggressions of wicked men in their mercenary or ambitious attempts to rob us of those inestimable blessings and unalienable rights which nature or rather nature s god has bestowed upon us in order to promote our happiness and the happiness of our posterity trust to god alone answered the quaker and he will protect them for us pardon me replied willoughby would not that be like casting ourselves from the pinnacle of solomon s temple and trusting to god to give his angels charge to bear us up this would be tempting god as the devil wished our saviour to tempt him when he made that proposition not knowing that he was addressing god himself but permit me to illustrate my first position that infernal spirits can only effect their evil designs in this world through the medium or agency of such unhappy mortals as have previously been brought under their wicked influence by passive compliance is a truth which no christian i presume will deny and hence by a transposition as logical as any in algebra the question before us when stripped of all external terms and forms appears to be this is it lawful upon gospel principles to arrest or oppose the movements of infernal spirits in attempting to deprive us of those blessings which a bountiful and gracious providence has bestowed upon us as men or as christians i would answer in the negative said the quaker let every meek just and pious man so oppressed plead rebuke and remonstrate against the impropriety impolicy and injustice of such offenders and to convince and turn the current of public opinion against them which would as it became general sweep gradually their oppressors into the fathomless ocean religion is supernatural and checks self defence but self defence sir is the first law of nature it is a principle implanted in us by god for the preservation of our lives it is this principle which prompts us to extend our hand when falling or to guard off an impending blow or if that is out of our power to disable the hand which is giving it i still think sir that it would be tempting the almighty to remain in either case perfectly passive and trust to him for protection i will grant replied brown that self defence is the first law of nature but those who are united to that which is
of considerable value gudeman she said to ochiltree as ye wad e er deserve mercy ye maun gang my errand to the house of glenallan and ask for the earl the earl of glenallan cummer ou he winna see ony o the gentles o the country and what likelihood is there that he wad see the like o an auld gaberlunzie gang your ways and try and tell him that elspeth o the craigburnfoot he ll mind me best by that name maun see him or she be relieved frae her lang pilgrimage and that she sends him that ring in token of the business she wad speak o ochiltree looked on the ring with some admiration of its apparent value and then carefully replacing it in the box and wrapping it in an old ragged handkerchief he deposited the token in his bosom weel gudewife he said i se do your bidding or it s no be my fault but surely there was never sic a braw propine as this sent to a yerl by an auld fishwife and through the hands of a gaberlunzie beggar with this reflection edie took up his pike staff put on his broad brimmed bonnet and set forth upon his pilgrimage the old woman remained for some time standing in a fixed posture her eyes directed to the door through which her ambassador had departed the appearance of excitation which the conversation had occasioned gradually left her features she sank down upon her accustomed seat and resumed her mechanical labour of the distaff and spindle with her wonted air of apathy edie ochiltree meanwhile advanced on his journey the distance to glenallan was ten miles a march which the old soldier accomplished in about four hours with the curiosity belonging to his idle trade and animated character he tortured himself the whole way to consider what could be the meaning of this mysterious errand with which he was entrusted or what connection the proud wealthy and powerful earl of glenallan could have with the crimes or penitence of an old doting woman whose rank in life did not greatly exceed that of her messenger he endeavoured to call to memory all that he had ever known or heard of the glenallan family yet having done so remained altogether unable to form a conjecture on the subject he knew that the whole extensive estate of this ancient and powerful family had descended to the countess lately deceased who inherited in a most remarkable degree the stern fierce and unbending character which had distinguished the house of glenallan since they first figured in scottish annals like the rest of her ancestors she adhered zealously to the roman catholic faith and was married to an english gentleman of the same communion and of large fortune who did not survive their union two years the countess was therefore left an early widow with the uncontrolled management of the large estates of her two sons the elder lord geraldin who was to succeed to the title and fortune of glenallan was totally dependent on his mother during her life the second when he came of age assumed the name and arms of his father and took possession of his estate according to the provisions of the countess s marriage settlement after this period he chiefly resided in england and paid very few and brief visits to his mother and brother and these at length were altogether dispensed with in consequence of his becoming a convert to the reformed religion but even before this mortal offence was given to its mistress his residence at glenallan offered few inducements to a gay young man like edward geraldin neville though its gloom and seclusion seemed to suit the retired and melancholy habits of his elder brother lord geraldin in the outset of life had been a young man of accomplishment and hopes those who knew him upon his travels entertained the highest expectations of his future career but such fair dawns are often strangely overcast the young nobleman returned to scotland and after living about a year in his mother s society at glenallan house he seemed to have adopted all the stern gloom and melancholy of her character excluded from politics by the incapacities attached to those of his religion and from all lighter avocationas by choice lord geraldin led a life of the strictest retirement his ordinary society was composed of the clergyman of his communion who occasionally visited his mansion and very rarely upon stated occasions of high festival one or two families who still professed the catholic religion were formally entertained at glenallan house but this was all their heretic neighbours knew nothing of the family whatever and even the catholics saw little more than the sumptuous entertainment and solemn parade which was exhibited on those formal occasions from which all returned without knowing whether most to wonder at the stern and stately demeanour of the countess or the deep and gloomy dejection which never ceased for a moment to cloud the features of her son the late event had put him in possession of his fortune and title and the neighbourhood had already begun to conjecture whether gaiety would revive with independence when those who had some occasional acquaintance with the interior of the family spread abroad a report that the earl s constitution was undermined by religious austerities and that in all probability he would soon follow his mother to the grave this event was the more probable as his brother had died of a lingering complaint which in the latter years of his life had affected at once his frame and his spirits so that heralds and genealogists were already looking back into their records to discover the heir of this ill fated family and lawyers were talking with gleesome anticipation of the probability of a great glenallan cause as edie ochiltree approached the front of glenallan house an ancient building of great extent
of our birth if we do not shake off the national prejudices as we would the local superstitions of the old world but above all let us not be influenced by any angry feelings so far as to shut our eyes to the perception of what is really excellent and amiable in the english character we are a young people necessarily an imitative one and must take our examples and models in a great degree from the existing nations of europe there is no country more worthy of our study than england the spirit of her constitution is most analogous to ours the manners of her people their intellectual activity their freedom of opinion their habits of thinking on those subjects which concern the dearest interests and most sacred charities of private life are all congenial to the american character and in fact are all intrinsically excellent for it is in the moral feeling of the people that the deep foundations of british prosperity are laid and however the superstructure may be timeworn or overrun by abuses there must be something solid in the basis admirable in the materials and stable in the structure of an edifice that so long has towered unshaken amidst the tempests of the world let it be the pride of our writers therefore discarding all feelings of irritation and disdaining to retaliate the illiberality of british authors to speak of the english nation without prejudice and with determined candor while they rebuke the indiscriminating bigotry with which some of our countrymen admire and imitate every thing english merely because it is english let them frankly point out what is really worthy of approbation we may thus place england before us as a perpetual volume of reference wherein are recorded sound deductions from ages of experience and while we avoid the errors and absurdities which may have crept into the page we may draw thence golden maxims of practical wisdom wherewith to strengthen and to embellish our national character rural life in england oh friendly to the best pursuits of man friendly to thought to virtue and to peace domestic life in rural pleasures past cowper the stranger who would form a correct opinion of the english character must not confine his observations to the metropolis he must go forth into the country he must sojourn in villages and hamlets he must visit castles villas farm houses cottages he must wander through parks and gardens along hedges and green lanes he must loiter about country churches attend wakes and fairs and other rural festivals and cope with the people in all their conditions and all their habits and humors in some countries the large cities absorb the wealth and fashion of the nation they are the only fixed abodes of elegant and intelligent society and the country is inhabited almost entirely by boorish peasantry in england on the contrary the metropolis is a mere gathering place or general rendezvous of the polite classes where they devote a small portion of the year to a hurry of gayety and dissipation and having indulged this kind of carnival return again to the apparently more congenial habits of rural life the various orders of society are therefore diffused over the whole surface of the kingdom and the more retired neighborhoods afford specimens of the different ranks the english in fact are strongly gifted with the rural feeling they possess a quick sensibility to the beauties of nature and a keen relish for the pleasures and employments of the country this passion seems inherent in them even the inhabitants of cities born and brought up among brick walls and bustling streets enter with facility into rural habits and evince a tact for rural occupation the merchant has his snug retreat in the vicinity of the metropolis where he often displays as much pride and zeal in the cultivation of his flower garden and the maturing of his fruits as he does in the conduct of his business and the success of a commercial enterprise even those less fortunate individuals who are doomed to pass their lives in the midst of din and traffic contrive to have something that shall remind them of the green aspect of nature in the most dark and dingy quarters of the city the drawing room window resembles frequently a bank of flowers every spot capable of vegetation has its grass plot and flower bed and every square its mimic park laid out with picturesque taste and gleaming with refreshing verdure those who see the englishman only in town are apt to form an unfavorable opinion of his social character he is either absorbed in business or distracted by the thousand engagements that dissipate time thought and feeling in this huge metropolis he has therefore too commonly a look of hurry and abstraction wherever he happens to be he is on the point of going somewhere else at the moment he is talking on one subject his mind is wandering to another and while paying a friendly visit he is calculating how he shall economize time so as to pay the other visits allotted to the morning an immense metropolis like london is calculated to make men selfish and uninteresting in their casual and transient meetings they can but deal briefly in commonplaces they present but the cold superfices of character its rich and genial qualities have no time to be warmed into a flow it is in the country that the englishman gives scope to his natural feelings he breaks loose gladly from the cold formalities and negative civilities of town throws off his habits of shy reserve and becomes joyous and free hearted he manages to collect round him all the conveniences and elegancies of polite life and to banish its restraints his country seat abounds with every requisite either for studious retirement tasteful gratification or rural exercise books paintings music horses dogs and sporting implements of all kinds are at hand he puts
holy office the fourth performer in this trial of memories was an ancient lady gaily dressed and intently eager on the game between her and the young man was a large pile of guineas which appeared to be her exclusive property from which she repeatedly during the play tendered one to his acceptance on the event of a hand or a trick and to which she seldom failed from inadvertence to add his mite contributing to accumulate the pile two double and the rub my dear doctor exclaimed the senior lady in triumph sir william you owe me ten the money was paid as easily as it had been won and the dowager proceeded to settle some bets with her female antagonist two more i fancy ma am said she closely scanning the contributions of the maiden i believe it is right my lady was the answer with a look that said pretty plainly that or nothing i beg pardon my dear here are but four and you remember two on the corner and four on the points doctor i will trouble you for a couple of guineas from miss wigram s store i am in haste to get to the countess s route the doctor was coolly helping himself from the said store under the watchful eyes of its owner and secretly exulting in his own judgment in requiring the stakes when the maiden replied in great warmth your ladyship forgets the two you lost to me at mrs howard s it must be a mistake my dear i always pay as i lose cried the dowager with great spirit stretching over the table and helping herself to the disputed money mr benfield and emily had stood silent spectators of the whole scene the latter in astonishment to meet such manners in such society and the former under feelings it would have been difficult to describe for in the face of the dowager which was inflamed partly from passion and more from high living he recognised the remains of his lady juliana now the dowager viscountess haverford emmy dear said the old man with a heavy drawn sigh as if awaking from a long and troubled dream we will go the phantom of forty years had vanished before the truth and the fancies of retirement simplicity and a diseased imagination yielded to the influence of life and common sense chapter xl with harriet now closely connected with them by marriage as well as attachment the baronet s family maintained a most friendly intercourse and mrs wilson and emily a prodigious favorite with her new cousin consented to pass a day soberly with her during an excursion of her husband to windsor on business connected with his station they had accordingly driven round to an early breakfast and chatterton after politely regretting his loss and thanking them for their consideration for his wife made his bow lady harriet denbigh had brought the baron a very substantial addition to his fortune and as his sisters were both provided for by ample settlements the pecuniary distresses which had existed a twelvemonth before had been entirely removed chatterton s income was now large his demands upon it small and he kept up an establishment in proportion to the rank of both husband and wife mrs wilson cried the hostess twirling her cup as she followed with her eyes the retreating figure of her husband at the door i am about to take up the trade of miss harris and become a match maker not on your own behalf so soon surely rejoined the widow oh no my fortune is made for life or not at all continued the other gaily but in behalf of our little friend emily here me cried emily starting from a reverie in which the prospect of happiness to lady laura was the subject you are very good harriet for whom do you intend me whom who is good enough for you but my cousin pendennyss ah she cried laughing as she caught emily by the hand derwent and myself both settled the matter long since and i know you will yield when you come to know him the duke cried the other with a surprise and innocence that immediately brought a blush of the brightest vermillion into her face yes the duke said lady chatterton you may think it odd for a discarded lover to dispose of his mistress so soon but both our hearts are set upon it the earl arrived last night and this day he and his sister dine with us in a sober way now my dear madam turning to mrs wilson have i not prepared an agreeable surprise for you surprise indeed said the widow excessively gratified at the probable termination to her anxieties for this meeting but where are they from from northamptonshire where the earl has already purchased a residence i understand and in your neighborhood too so you perceive he at least begins to think of the thing a certain evidence truly cried emily his having purchased the house but was he without a residence that he bought the deanery oh no he has a palace in town and three seats in the country but none in northamptonshire but this said the lady with a laugh to own the truth he did offer to let george denbigh have it for the next summer but the colonel chose to be nearer eltringham and i take it it was only a ruse in the earl to cloak his own designs you may depend upon it we trumpeted your praises to him incessantly in westmoreland and is colonel denbigh in town said mrs wilson stealing an anxious glance towards her niece who in spite of all her efforts sensibly changed color oh yes and laura is as happy as happy as myself said lady chatterton with a glow on her cheeks as she attended to the request of her housekeeper and left the
or firmness enough to contemplate our approaching destiny without the cheering of some more determined countenance than their own the wind was strong all day and the sea ran very high our boat taking in water from her leaks continually so that we were obliged to keep one man constantly bailing during the night the weather became extremely rugged and the sea every now and then broke over us by agreement we were divided into two watches one of which was to be constantly awake and doing the labours of the boat such as bailing setting taking in and trimming the sails we kept our course very well together during this night and had many opportunities of conversation with the men in the other boats wherein the means and prospects of our deliverance were variously considered it appeared from the opinions of all that we had most to hope for in the meeting with some vessel and most probably some whale ship the great majority of whom in those seas we imagined were cruising about the latitude we were then steering for but this was only a hope the realization of which did not in any degree depend on our own exertions but on chance alone it was not therefore considered prudent by going out of our course with the prospect of meeting them to lose sight for one moment of the strong probabilities which under divine providence there were of our reaching land by the route we had prescribed to ourselves as that depended most especially on a reasonable calculation and on our own labours we conceived that our provision and water on a small allowance would last us sixty days that with the trade wind on the course we were then lying we should be able to average the distance of a degree a day which in days would enable us to attain the region of the variable winds and then in thirty more at the very utmost should there by any favour in the elements we might reach the coast with these considerations we commenced our voyage the total failure of all which and the subsequent dismal distress and suffering by which we were overtaken will be shown in the sequel our allowance of provision at first consisted of bread one biscuit weighing about one pound three ounces and half a pint of water a day for each man this small quantity less than one third which is required by an ordinary person small as it was we however took without murmuring and on many an occasion afterwards blest god that even this pittance was allowed to us in our misery the darkness of another night overtook us and after having for the first time partook of our allowance of bread and water we laid our weary bodies down in the boat and endeavoured to get some repose nature became at last worn out with the watchings and anxieties of the two preceding nights and sleep came insensibly upon us no dreams could break the strong fastenings of forgetfulness in which the mind was then locked up but for my own part my thoughts so haunted me that this luxury was yet a stranger to my eyes every recollection was still fresh before me and i enjoyed but a few short and unsatisfactory slumbers caught in the intervals between my hopes and my fears the dark ocean and swelling waters were nothing the fears of being swallowed up by some dreadful tempest or dashed upon hidden rocks with all the other ordinary subjects of fearful contemplation seemed scarcely entitled to a moment s thought the dismal looking wreck and the horrid aspect and revenge of the whale wholly engrossed my reflections until day again made its appearance november rd in my chest which i was fortunate enough to preserve i had several small articles which we found of great service to us among the rest some eight or ten sheets of writing paper a lead pencil a suit of clothes three small fish hooks a jack knife besides other useful purposes served us as a razor it was with much difficulty however that i could keep any sort of record owing to the incessant rocking and unsteadiness of the boat and the continual dashing of the spray of the sea over us the boat contained in addition to the articles enumerated a lantern tinderbox and two or three candles which belonged to her and with which they are kept always supplied while engaged in taking whale in addition to all which the captain had saved a musket two pistols and a canister containing about two pounds of gunpowder the latter he distributed in equal proportions between the three boats and gave the second mate and myself each a pistol when morning came we found ourselves quite near together and the wind had considerably increased since the day before we were consequently obliged to reef our sales and although we did not apprehend any very great danger from the then violence of the wind yet it grew to be very uncomfortable in the boats from the repeated dashing of the waves that kept our bodies constantly wet with the salt spray we however stood along our course until twelve o clock when we got an observation as well as we were able to obtain one while the water flew all over us and the sea kept the boat extremely unsteady we found ourselves this day in latitude s having repassed the equator we abandoned the idea altogether of keeping any correct longitudinal reckoning having no glass nor log line the wind moderated in the course of the afternoon a little but at night came on to blow again almost a gale we began now to tremble for our little barque she was so ill calculated in point of strength to withstand the racking of the sea while it required the constant labours of one man to keep her
giving her the picturesque and and beautiful aspect of a greek girl and now she would toss it wildly over her temples and bosom till she resembled some terrified bacchante his own daughters sat laughing and pouting by her side occasionally interfering and squabbling about the gracefulness and effect of this cluster or that waving luxuriant mass that flowed as if it were liquid silk over her shoulders he laid his parental hand upon loena s head and put his lips to her forehead she coloured but seized his hand and blessed him with that fervour that innocent and natural fervour which is not to be counterfeited or affected her emotion choked her the conversation so long dreaded was soon began and the countenances of all grew more and more serious mournful sad as he proceeded until there was not a dry eye in the room a frigate was to sail the same evening for calaisharold was to depart in her harold faintly articulated the gasping girl shut her eyes harold echoed all the others the word died away on their lips they all clung to poor loena with hands and mouths as she buried her face in the lap of the countess a sad presentiment sat heavily upon her heart so much admonition so much advice so much gentle insinuation so many new feelings and thoughts about propriety conjured up it could not be for slight purposes yet what was she to fear they were to go together together were they oh yes but then he said harold harold only i will go she exclaimed starting upon her feet forgetful of their presence i will go with him the wide world over let me see who shall dare to oppose me harold come thou to my defence they had been watching every movement and devandreueil now left the room saying to his wife significantly that he left loena to her care oh said the countess after a few moments of mournful silence while the dim eyes of the indian girl were searching out the mystery of this behaviour with a look unutterable expostulation oh as if she that moment recollected herself oh how long is it my dear she stopped a moment for she found it exceedingly difficult to make herself intelligible to loena whose early lessons in french were but just beginning to revive besides she was startled at her own abruptness and inwardly awed at the calm melancholy the beautiful self possession that arose gradually upon the youthful countenance before her as if to rebuke all particular inquiry so much for her lessons in propriety but her lip trembled and she pressed the hand of the countess and put her mouth meekly upon the blue veins as if conscious that this was not the time for the princess to be seen no but for the woman the tender and impassioned woman alone a tear fell upon the hand she stooped with her luxuriant tresses and would have wiped it away but her mother fur thrice had the lady called her daughter and her heart earned to show its sensibility to the endearing relationship her mother forbad it and dismissed the girl and children with her hand i am abrupt love she said i know that i am but thy frank nature is accustomed to that thou art a woman a young inexperienced and enthusiastick woman i tremble for thee here thou hast come a stranger my child an innocent unfriended unsupported helpless stranger among strangers loena s eyes overflowed with no brother no lather no sister not even one of thy nation loena attempted to speak what sayest thou lover nay do not weep poor loena sobbed as if her heart would break the countess continued no father no mother oh yes thou hast i will be thy mother my sweet girl wilt thou be my daughter i will o i will faintly whispered the fainting girl bid me as thou wilt i will do thy bidding my mother my dear dear mother the countess embraced her passionately the contact was inconceivably affecting to both loena felt as if her own mother had risen from the grave and the countess as if caressing her youngest born the child of her old age behold them a beautiful woman a french woman a parisienne locked to the bosom of a young american an indian girl brown and sparkling with barbarian ornament locked too as a mother and daughter in overwhelming and inexpressible tenderness it was the union of ministering intelligences the priesthood of loveliness among the oppressors and the oppressed fashion and nature the perfection of art and the simplicity of unadulterate uncontaminate nature my daughter compose thyself continued the countess lean awhile on me the bosom of thy mother why how thy temples throb child and the sweat i declare thy hair is wet on thy forehead with it verily verily but thou art fearfully and wonderfully made we are all so woman is at best but frailly delicately constituted but thou art so in an especial manner more a thing of intellect and nerve and spirit than aught that i know even among women come come cheer up and prepare thyself thy heart too why it is coming through thy side it feels mother as if it would indeed answered the trembling girl as she shook back her redundant hair and looked up in her face with a quivering lip and a pale very pale cheek it feels mother as if it were nothing but ashes o it is dry pulverised there is no moisture in it i would weep but i cannot weep i cannot shed another tear but go on my mother o how it delights me to pronounce the strange word ma mere ma mere i am prepared saying this she arose and sat upright upheld and sustained by her own unconquerable spirit now was to be the trial she was sure of it
said poor lucy i never felt so much for her that s right child now we will go on but first let that tear drop that glistens in the moonbeam fall on the grave it helps to keep the grass green and the dead like to be cried for she added mournfully they now proceeded crazy bet leading the way with long and hasty strides in a diagonal course still ascending the hill till she plunged into a deep wood so richly clothed with foliage as to be impervious to the moon beams and so choaked with underbrush that jane found it very difficult to keep up with her pioneer they soon however emerged into an open space completely surrounded and enclosed by lofty trees crazy bet had not spoken since they began their walk she now stopped and turning abruptly to jane do you know said she who are the worshippers that meet in this temple the spirits that were sometime disobedient but since he went and preached to them they came out from their prison house and worship in the open air and under the light of the blessed heavens it is a beautiful spot said jane i should think all obedient spirits might worship in this temple say you so then worship with me the maniac fell on her knees jane knelt beside her she had caught a spark of her companion s enthusiasm the singularity of her situation the beauty of the night the novelty of the place on which the moon now riding high in the heavens poured a flood of silver light all conspired to give a high tone to her feelings it is not strange she should have thought she never heard any thing so sublime as the prayer of her crazed conductor who raised her arms and poured out her soul in passages of scripture the most sublime and striking woven together by her own glowing language she concluded suddenly and springing on her feet said to jane now follow me fear not and falter not for you know what awaits the fearful and unbelieving jane assured her she had no fear but that of being too late you need not think of that the spirit never quits till i come they now turned into the wood by a narrow pathway whose entrance laid under the shadow of two young beach trees crazy bet paused see ye these child said she pointing to the trees i know two who grew up thus on the same spot of earth so lovingly they grew and she pointed to the interlacing of the branches young and beautiful but the pxe was laid to the root of one and the other and she pressed both her hands on her head and screamed wildly died here a burst of tears afforded her a sudden relief poor broken hearted creature murmured jane no child when she weeps then the band is loosened for added she drawing closer to jane and whispering they put an iron band around her head and when she is in darkness it presses till she thinks she is in the place of the tormenter by the light of the moon it s loosened you cannot see it but it is there always there jane began now to be alarmed at the excitement of bet s imagination and turning from her abruptly entered the path which after they had proceeded a few yards seemed to be leading them into a wild trackless region where are we going bet she exclaimed through a pass child that none knows but the wild bird and the wild woman have you never heard of the caves of the mountain yes replied jane but i had rather not go through them to night cannot we go some other way nay there is no other way follow me and fear not jane had often heard of the pass called the mountain caves and she believed it had only been penetrated by a few rash youths of daring and adventurous spirit she was appalled at the thought of entering it in the dead of night and with such a conductor she paused but she could see no way of escape and summoning all her resolution she followed bet who took no note of her scruples they now entered a defile which apparently had been made by some tremendous convulsion of nature that had rent the mountain asunder and piled rock on rock in the deep abyss the breadth of the passage which was walled in by the perpendicular sides of the mountain was not in any place more than twenty feet and sometimes so narrow that jane thought she might have extended her arms quite across it but she had no leisure for critical accuracy her wayward guide pressed on heedless of the difficulties of the way she would pass between huge rocks that had rolled so near together as to leave but a very narrow passage between them then grasping the tangled roots that projected from the side of the mountain and placing her feet in the fissures of the rocks or in the little channels that had been worn by the continual dropping from the mountain rills she would glide over swiftly and safely as if she had been on the beaten highway they were sometimes compelled in the depths of the caverns to prostrate themselves and creep through narrow apertures between the rocks it was impossible to surmount and jane felt that she was passing over masses of ice the accumulation perhaps of a hundred winters she was fleet and agile and inspired with almost supernatural courage she though a woman naturally born to fears followed on resolutely till they came to an immense rock whose conical and giant form rested on broken masses below that on every side were propping this mighty monarch of the scene for the first time crazy bet seemed to remember she had a
facilitate his passage by enabling him the more easily to drag his body through the only obstacle that perplexed him was a strong iron grating that was fixed over its entrance this he however was determined to overcome by some energetic effort his chief difficulty was in persuading the doctor as to the practicability of the scheme at length when the latter perceived that no reasoning would prevent peter from trying it he determined not to desert him but to assist all he could although he anticipated all the evil consequences of complete failure and detection in pursuance of this resolution having secretly provided a small bag full of provisions and a couple of spades they one dark night about two weeks after the doctor s rescue when all the garrison except the sentinels had gone to sleep scaled the low wooden fence that surrounded the washer woman s yard and commenced their operations by digging a hole close to the grate sufficiently large to admit their entrance as the ground was soft and peter an excellent spadesman this was only the work of about fifteen minutes and into the mud bottomed pit he plunged without hesitation head foremost dragging by means of a strong cord attached to it the bag of provisions after him the doctor had now nothing for it but to follow for the first three or four yards they swam or paddled like ducks in the stagnant water which had here collected to the depth of eight or ten inches on account of some deficiency in its fall towards the creek but this was the easiest part of their progress for during the remainder peter found the passage so small that it required all his perseverance and strength to squeeze himself forward which however he persisted in doing and at last with incredible labour and not without great fatigue and soreness of both flesh and bones he arrived at the open air on the bank of the creek the doctor being a smaller man found less difficulty in passing especially as the efforts of peter had cleared the way for him although enveloped in a complete vesture of mud and dirt our adventurers did not wait to wash themselves in the creek but taking to the woods hastened on as speedily as the darkness and the numerous impediments of the way would permit towards the alleghany river daylight overtook them while yet in the intricacies of the forest when being both hungry and fatigued they thought proper to enjoy some of such fare as their bag afforded and then to repose themselves for a few hours about noon they again proceeded and continued their journey till the evening when resolving not to undergo the fatigue of another night struggling amidst brush wood swamps and fallen timber they selected a place of shelter and by collecting together a quantity of dry leaves made themselves as comfortable a bed as they could on which their fatigue and long wakefulness enabled them to sleep soundly till the morning after three days troublesome journeying in this manner during which they became sometimes afraid of not being on their proper course they arrived at the alleghany river a short distance below its confluence with french creek from thence they kept down the stream of the river for upwards of four days and it was the ninth from their leaving le boeuf before they met with charles as already stated chapter xv survey his front where wisdom sits serene and the bright flashing of his fearless eye that gallant port that majesty of mien which promise deeds of unsurpass d emprise such as to minstrelsy its fondest theme supplies and gains the palm the world may not deny basket of scraps the dearest to each other are often doomed to part it is one of the evils incident to humanity and one from which all the philosophy in the world will not relieve us the best way therefore to meet the evil is to do it courageously and philosophize nothing about it charles adderly on this occasion did so and in consequence he succeeded in separating from maria with a reluctant heart it must be confessed but not with a desponding one his party consisting of himself dr killbreath paddy frazier peter m fall and manhulseh their indian guide commenced their journey on the third day after peter and the doctor had arrived at frazier s besides the horses on which they rode they had along with them three others two of which were laden with paddy s merchandise and the third with provisions and other traveling stores they were of course well armed for in those days no one ever thought of attempting a journey of even a short distance through the wilderness without being properly prepared for both defence and attack on the third day they crossed the chesnut ridge and encamped that night between it and the laurel hill in what is now called ligonier valley as they were about continuing their journey the next morning they were unexpectedly attacked by a small party of otawas whom the french had despatched to scour the country in pursuit of peter and the doctor the savages however had given their fire at too great a distance to do any serious mischief two of their shots feebly pierced through a package of paddy s furs and another slightly wounded one of the horses the rest fell altogether harmless each of our travellers immediately took to a tree and kept up such a well directed fire upon their enemies when any of them dared to appear in sight that the latter thought proper about mid day to withdraw after having lost five or six of their number who were killed on the spot our party then cautiously proceeded onwards keeping on all directions a good look out which obliged them to travel so slowly that they only reached the top of the laurel
a vacant stare some few years afterward during the late war i saw the same man approaching again and i resolved to check his career accordingly i stepped into the middle of the road and stretched wide both my arms and cried stop sir on your peril at this the man said now lightfoot confound the robber at the same time he gave the whip liberally to the flank of his horse which bounded off with such force that it appeared to me two such horses give them a place to stand would overcome any check man could devise an ammunition wagon which had just passed on to baltimore had dropped an eighteen pounder in the road this unlucky ball lay in the way of the horse s heels and the beast with the sagacity of a demon clinched it with of his heels and hurled it behind him i feel dizzy in relating the fact but so nearly did the ball pass my head that the wind thereof blew off my hat and the ball embedded itself in that gate post as you may see if you will cast your eye on the post i have permitted it to remain there in memory of the occurrence as the people of boston i am told preserve the eighteen pounder which is now to be seen half embedded in brattle street church i then took leave of the toll gatherer and promised him if i saw or heard of his gate i would send him notice a strong inclination had possessed me to arrest rugg and search his pockets thinking great discoveries might be made in the examination but what i saw and heard that day convinced me that no human force could detain peter rugg against his consent i therefore determined if i ever saw rugg again to treat him in the gentlest manner in pursuing my way to new york i entered on the turnpike in trenton and when i arrived at new brunswick i perceived the road was newly macadamized the small stones had just been laid thereon as i passed this piece of road i observed that at regular distances of about eight feet the stones were entirely displaced from spots as large as the circumference of a half bushel measure this singular appearance induced me to inquire the cause of it at the turnpike gate sir said the toll gatherer i wonder not at the question but i am unable to give you a satisfactory answer indeed sir i believe i am bewitched and that the turnpike is under a spell of enchantment for what appeared to me last night cannot be a real transaction otherwise a turnpike is a useless thing i do not believe in witchcraft or enchantment said i and if you will relate circumstantially what happened last night i will endeavour to account for it by natural means you may recollect the night was uncommonly dark well sir just after i had closed the gate for the night down the turnpike as far as my eye could reach i beheld what at first appeared to be two armies engaged the report of the musketry and the flashes of their firelocks were incessant and continuous as this strange spectacle approached me with the fury of a tornado the noise increased and the appearance rolled on in one compact body over the surface of the ground the most splendid fireworks rose out of the earth and encircled this moving spectacle the divers tints of the rainbow the most brilliant dyes that the sun lays in the lap of spring added to the whole family of gems could not display a more beautiful radiant and dazzling spectacle than accompanied the black horse you would have thought all the stars of heaven had met in merriment on the turnpike in the midst of this luminous configuration sat a man distinctly to be seen in a miserable looking chair drawn by a black horse the turnpike gate ought by the laws of nature and the laws of the state to have made a wreck of the whole and have dissolved the enchantment but no the horse without an effort passed over the gate and drew the man and chair horizontally after him without touching the bar this was what i call enchantment what think you sir my friend said i you have grossly magnified a natural occurrence the man was peter rugg on his way to boston it is true his horse travelled with unequalled speed but as he reared high his forefeet he could not help displacing the thousand small stones on which he trod which flying in all directions struck one another and resounded and scintillated the top bar of your gate is not more than two feet from the ground and rugg s horse at every vault could easily lift the carriage over that gate this satisfied mr mcdoubt and i was pleased at that occurrence for otherwise mr mcdoubt who is a worthy man late from the highlands might have added to his calendar of superstitions having thus disenchanted the macadamized road and the turnpike gate and also mr mcdoubt i pursued my journey homeward to new york little did i expect to see or hear anything further of mr rugg for he was now more than twelve hours in advance of me i could hear nothing of him on my way to elizabethtown and therefore concluded that during the past night he had turned off from the turnpike and pursued a westerly direction but just before i arrived at powles s hook i observed a considerable collection of passengers in the ferry boat all standing motionless and steadily looking at the same object one of the ferry men mr hardy who knew me well observing my approach delayed a minute in order to afford me a passage and coming up said mr dunwell we have a curiosity on board that would puzzle
sword against the french and indians in this land of promise he referred to the scriptural account of the march of the israelites from the land of egypt and the house of bondage and applied it literally as did many others to the emigration of the puritans and he derived his authority for much of his own conduct from the fighting part of the character of joshua the onondagas the tuscaroras the wampagoes and the potawatamies were with him but the other names for the hittites perezites jebuzites and gergushites all whom were to be exterminated indeed if father raal in his way from penobscot to his catholic friends had fallen into the hands of miles standish he would have considered the fate of agag as his sufficient warrant he possessed vigorous strength was patient of fatigue and fixed in his purpose a man as southey says firm to resolve and stubborn to endure he sat reading pilgrim s progress which he allegorized beyond the spirit of bunyan himself letter xi after hearing du quesne without interruption are you said he true men and no spies is it not to spy out the nakedness of the land ye are come you sir must be a frenchman and surely if ever i saw one this is an indian know you not that it is against such that i have come to fight i have the authority of scripture history it is in vain for the keemites to attempt deceiving me with their old shoes and clouted tattered garments and moldy bread and broken bottles the dialogue between them lasted some time the engaging manners and conversation of du quesne interested the chieftain though it was apparent he doubted the truth of the story and looked on the disinterested heroism of weshop particularly as apocryphal but aside from his incredulity and some strong suspicions of design he resolved not to cross the jake but to keep his provincials within the boundary of new england he cared as little for the dutch as for the french let them said he to himself fight it out between themselves and if the indians take sides so much the better great was the joy of du quesne when he heard that dudley his long lost and as he supposed far distant friend was on the spot and the second in command he hastened to his quarters where he found dubourg and his daughter standish was present at this cordial interview and listened once more but with greater confidence and interest to the story and request the anxiety of dudley was extreme he saw the emaciated form of du quesne worn down by famine fatigue and suffering represented to himself the exposure of van tromp to a fate from which it might even now be too late to save him and made up his mind i will go and that immediately if i go alone major standish said he this is no matter of political or provincial interest it is my private business and of great emergency providence gives me this opportunity perhaps the only one of redeeming a sacred pledge my sworn my bosom friend is in peril see said he pointing to weshop what an example even this man has set me ah he s a keenite said standish wringing weshop s hand worthy to be ranked with squantum himself in a case like this i will not be outdone by the best heathen that ever lived weshop but come there s no time to lose beat to arms i wish added he in a lower tone to dudley that weshop was a christian he would make a better one than some white men i know of but now have the boats ready i ll show you how to deal with indians when you catch them on fair ground in a body weshop you must lead us captain dudley we march indian file without music three ferriages will carry over as many as we want let the ladies stay with those who keep guard at the camp if i do nt return i ll send for them during the bustle of a slight and rapid preparation the young lady found means to set her large dark eyes on du quesne and beckon him towards her this sir said she is no time for ceremony or affected delicacy i feel interested for the safety of your friend i shall wait here oh with how much anxiety to hear of your arrival in time to save him and beg that as soon as it is safe i may be immediately sent for to join you and mr dudley at the blasted tree i know from your zeal you will save him i know you will but you have eaten nothing these hasty men have forgotten to ask you and you have forgotten to call here i will set a table for you and wait upon you myself i must not eat without my friend who the indian warrior that brought me here oh weshop i know him let me call him myself weshop came back but the honest fellow could not stay for a regular meal he took a quantity of provision in his hand to eat as he went onward to the place of embarkation saying as he left the shore make haste make haste the party in fine order and under strict discipline were soon paraded marched and wheeled to the landing the lake at a narrow place was ferried over again and again till all but a guard for the defence of the women and the few effects that were left behind had quit the shore miles standish directed the embarkation himself and brought up the rear in the last boat with his drummer trumpeter and bugleman and as he had an ear for music and a strong taste for sublime scenery he directed them to play old hundred and accompanied them with his
more daring in the declaration of his belief but it was not until the sabbath after ordination that he publicly evinced his adherence to the rites of the episcopal church a meeting was held in a vacant building which had been erected as a common house until more convenient dwellings could be procured here a considerable number were collected and the english ritual was read and the sacrament administered by mr blackstone in his full canonical robes according to the ceremonies prescribed by james and his bishops at the council of hampton house this was a thing not to be passed over mr blackstone living alone in his solitary hut at tri mountain was out of their jurisdiction but brown and his brother were the next morning ordered to appear before an assembly of the elders to answer the charges brought against them at o clock in the afternoon the inhabitants of salem were seen again collecting at their meetinghouse to hear what could be said in defence of the culprits after a suitable pause the governor arose as he said you mr charles and samuel brown are accused of fomenting disturbance among the people forasmuch as you have taught them that under the shadow of the mitre is the only place where men ought to worship do you plead guilty thereto that i bow with reverence before the holy mitre is most true governor endicott but in no respect whatever have i bred disturbance among the people have you not interrupted mr conant have you not made them drink of the wine of babylon yea have you not made them drunk with her fornication have you not like the red dragon pursued the church into the wilderness and poured out a flood after her that you might cause her to be destroyed my answers are to governor endicott and the elders of what you term the church replied brown with respectful coldness mr conant said the governor these things should be done decently and in order it is the business of men in authority to inquire into this matter have you young man upheld the ritual of the firstborn daughter of the church of rome and maintained that the arm of royal authority ought to enforce obedience thereto i have said replied brown that religio docenda est non coercenda was a bad maxim of state policy and that hresis dedocenda est non permittenda was a far better if by the first born daughter of rome you mean that church descended in a direct line from jesus christ and his apostles a church at the feet of which the most sacred and virtuous elizabeth bowed down her majestic head and beneath the shelter of whose mighty arm the learned king james and our liege prince charles have reposed their triple diadem if you mean this church i do say her sublime ritual should be enforced till every fibre of the king s dominions yields a response thereto saints have worn her white robe and her mitre has rested on holy men the sacred water hath been on my unworthy head and therewithal have their hands signed the mystic symbol of redemption and i would rather continued he raising the tones of his fine manly voice i would rather give my limbs to the wolves of your desert than see her sceptre broken by men like yourselves think you said governor endicott smiling that king james cared aught for the church save that he considered it the basis of the throne you forget his open declaration in the assembly at edinburgh the church of geneva saith he keepeth pasche and yule what have they for them they have no institution as for our neighbour kirk of england their service is an evil said mass in english they want none of the mass but the liftings king james had not then come to the english throne answered brown he found cause to alter his opinion after he had felt the blessed influence of that church and seen many of her corner stones elect and precious nay mr brown rejoined the governor there is enow wherewithal to convince your reason for you are not wanting in the light which leadeth astray that it was king craft which made james turn his back upon a church whereunto he had given the name of the sincerest kirk in the whole world and with all reverence to his royal memory i cannot but think that his love of forms and ceremonies was but a taint of hereditary evil from his moabitish mother forasmuch as i am a loyal subject of king charles it is neither wise nor safe for me to find specks and blemishes in his government but to my thinking there is but a fine spun thread between the crosier and the liturgy the embroidered mantle and the bishop s gown and who does not know that the heart of the king is fastened to the rosary of henrietta maria and that the mummeries of rome are at her instigation heard within the palace of st james but after all mr brown there is one higher than princes it was a cardinal truth which cardinal pole spake unto henry the eighth penes reges inferre bellum penes autem deum terminare and i marvel that men of sense like yourself governor endicott can expect the sword of the lord to be quiet in its scabbard when the robe of religion is torn and her altars overturned replied brown and that too by men unto whom you give your countenance a parcel of separatists and

chapter i slow up the tide the gaudy bark comes on her oars scarce startling the unruffled air the waters to her swan like prow give place along the oar blades leap up to the sun in lucid flakes and dance as twere their sport to waft that beauteous freight milman towards the close of a sultry day in the latter part of the eventful summer of a small detachment of american troops halted for the night on the northern bank of james river not many miles above williamsburg in virginia it was one of those numerous bodies which issuing from the main army under general la fayette daily scoured the country for many miles in the vicinity of yorktown where lord cornwallis had taken post for the purpose of intercepting the various foraging parties of the enemy this gallant little band whose whole force did not exceed a hundred and fifty was led by a young french officer ardent and chivalrous as the dauntless chief he served and whose generous example first stimulated him as it had done thousands of his countrymen beside to quit the lilied fields of france and lend his aid to free oppressed america from the bonds of her enslavers their enterprise on this day had proved successful they had encountered a superior force and after a short but resolute contest the foe had seen fit to retire in haste and leave the assailants masters of the field the weary step of the soldiers evinced how dearly their laurels had been won but every eye brightened when they reached the long wished for resting place and the superior officer gave the word to halt in a few minutes the bustle of a camp chased away the silence which evening was gently shedding over the sequestered spot tents were pitched arms stacked and fires kindled with the haste of men anxious for repose some eagerly ran for water to the river some busied themselves in preparations for their evening meal while others yielding to the effect of overpowering weariness lay stretched supinely on the grass already locked in sleep or gazing with listless indolence upon the movements of their more active comrades small knots of officers stood here and there discussing the events of the day though they gradually dispersed to seek the luxury of a bath in the cool stream on the banks of which they had encamped for an hour the shores of the james resounded with gay voices and bursts of cheerful merriment and its waters dimpled and curled left an undulating track far behind the course of the practised swimmers who tried their fleetness in this favourite art but presently group after group retired and two persons only remained standing on the now silent shore the elder of these was the leader of the force which we have introduced to the notice of the reader he was just at that period of life when youth is deepening into manhood ahd the fine proportions of his noble figure the foreign grace of his air the depth of feeling and of thought which softened the eagle brightness of his eye were all singularly marked and attractive his dress though exhibiting the form and colours of the american uniform was distinguished by its superior richness his bearing was somewhat lofty and when silent his countenance might have been thought to ind icate a stern and haughty temper but when in conversation or otherwise animated it was irradiated by the finest and most captivating expression and in his beaming smile there was a magic which few hearts could resist at the moment of which we write he stood with folded arms and an air of deep abstraction upon the very brink of the river watching the tranquil flow of its waters tinged vflth the beautiful hues of twilight and reflecting on their waveless surface the glowing heavens and the verdant banks with all their graceful drapery of trees and overhanging vines a few paces apart stood his companion a gallant boy on whose cheek health bloomed and whose ruddy lip was not yet shaded with the down of manhood he too was in a meditative posture but his attention was bent upon a different object and as he gazed long and earnestly upon the white chimnies of a large mansion which appeared at no great distance rising from the midst of imbosoming groves the brightness of his eye saddened and a half murmured exclamation burst forth with art impassioned sigh which seemed to rend his heart major st olmar was startled from his reverie by the melancholy sound and bending his anxious eye upon the youth how now my young lieutenant he exclaimed drooping like yonder water lily after the glory of such a day a day which has wreathed fresh laurels for your brows and sealed your right to be numbered with the brave the youth dashed away a starting tear and said as he turned with a smile of affection towards his friend and even the bravest of the brave may not deem those laurels decreed me by his friendship tarnished though their leaves sometimes glisten with the tear unmanly as it seems which the remembrance of former days awakens but why these sad remembrances now my dear edward asked st olmar one would think the events of this day of a nature to produce only pleasurable emotions and awaken bright hopes for the future in a heart like yours instead of calling up a train of vain regrets which have transformed my gallant soldier to a tearful girl nay do not reproach me said the youth i cannot if i would school my heart to forgetfuluess yonder pointing to the mansion which had excited his emotion yonder is the residence of colonel walstein the abode of my sister the scene of many many days of happiness forgive me my dear leslie said st olmar grieved that he should have treated with levity his
my master s theory at last however he cut me short by d g his eyes if he believed there was any way to make a man perfect except by making a perfect sailor of him there was however a fellow passenger on board who i found to be more reasonable and less under the dominion of the counteracting principles we had frequent discussions on the subject and i opened to him all my plans without reserve not omitting the sum of money i had with me to invest in the perfect community he became a complete convert to the new view of society and we agreed to co operate zealously in the great work of perfectibility we went to live at the same lodgings where we digested a plan of operations for the future the second day after landing he came to me to say that by a great piece of ill luck the merchant on whom he had a credit for a large sum was out of town and could not supply him with funds but i should not have minded that so much said he except that another merchant to whom i am indebted in part of this money insists on my paying him immediately now all i want is for you to advance me the sum till the day after to morrow when the person on whom my bills are drawn will be in town he offered to show me the bills but on second thoughts had left them with the merchant s clerk the sum he wanted was nearly all i was worth in the world but i lent it with as little hesitation as my friend borrowed it he then left me to go and pay the debt he spoke of desiring me to have dinner ready at four o clock when he would certainly be back but four came without my friend and hour after hour passed without his appearing the dinner grew cold for i had no inclination to eat not that i was uneasy about my money but my friend i was afraid that his simplicity had been imposed on or that like me he might have been mistaken for a mad man and put in a lunatic asylum a week passed away without my seeing him during which time the remainder of my money had disappeared also i began to grow uneasy and one day took a solitary walk in the envrions of the city to reflect on my situation and ponder on the mysterious disappearance of my friend what was my joy on turning round a short corner to meet him face to face when i least expected i was rejoiced to see him but i cannot say that he appeared to share my raptures my dear man machine cried i i am so delighted to meet you again i was afraid they had put you in a mad house for believing in perfectibility by the way i have spent every farthing of my money and will thank you to let me have what i lent you what in a community where all things are to be in common you forget the new view of society said he with a sort of sneer i did not like yes but the system you know is not yet in operation no matter the principles on which it is founded are eternal and immutable sir if a community of goods is right in one case it is right in another your money is gone you do nt say so said i in great dismay gone sir i have considered myself as acting up to the sublime principles of the new system by distributing it among the community upon the just basis of mutual wants and mutual conveniences the tailor has some of it the jeweller the hatter the tavern keeper has each his share but the last guineas went for a couple of dozen bingham wine which would do your heart good even to smell at you shall come this blessed day and help crack a bottle hey my fine piece of perfectibility so then you have spent all my money your money my dear friend you again forget the sublime doctrines of the new system of society you have only to consider each of these persons who have received a share of your money as members of our community and you will acknowledge that it could not possibly belong to you i believe you are a great rascal my dear friend how can you make that out you have cheated me of my money my good friend you are certainly under the dominion of the counteracting principles if ever a man was in this world but suppose for the sake of argument that i had defrauded you of your money what then am i to blame who else in the name of common sense do nt mention common sense i beseech you it has nothing to do with the new system of society we must try the question by our great master s first principles agreed well then can you deny that all the errors inconsistencies and crimes of the man machine for the last six thousand years may be traced in a direct line to the absurd and mischievous system of education which has prevailed all that time no very well and can you deny the immortal and immutable truth of the great principle of perfectibility that no man can be justly held responsible for his opinions or his actions i do not deny it very well then answer me thou ricketty addle pated imperfect machine whether even supposing i had actually defrauded you of your money i am to be blamed for it you must blame the erroneous system of society and if you punish any body it must be my parents who did not take sufficient care to put down the rascally counteracting principles and you think yourself
to the house chapter ix untaught in youth my heart to tame my springs of life were poison d tis too late yet i am chang d though still enough the same in strength to bear what time cannot abate and feed on bitter fruits without accusing fate lord byron father gilbert stopped a few paces from the spot which lucie had just quitted and leaning against a tree appeared so entirely absorbed by his own reflections that de valette for some moments hesitated to address him the rapid mutations of his countenance still betrayed a powerful mental struggle and de valette felt his curiosity and interest strongly awakened by the sudden and uncontrollable excitement of one whose usually cold and abstracted air shewed little sympathy with the concerns of humanity gradually however his features resumed their accustomed calmness but on raising his eyes and meeting the inquiring gaze of de valette he drooped his head as if ashamed to have betrayed emotions so inconsistent with the vow which professed to raise him above the influence of all worldly passions i fear you are ill father said de valette approaching him with kindness can i do anything to assist or relieve you i was ill my son he replied but it is over now passed away like a troubled phantasy which visits the weary and restless slumberer and flies at the approach of returning reason your language is figurative returned de valette and implies the sufferance of mental rather than bodily pain if such is your unhappy state i know full well that human skill is unavailing what know you of pain asked the priest with startling energy you who bask in the sunshine of fortune s smile whose days are one ceaseless round of careless gaiety whose repose is yet unbroken by the gnawing worm of never dying repentance such too i was in the spring time of my life i drained the cup of pleasure but misery and disappointment were in its dregs i yielded to the follies and passions of my youthful heart and the sting of remorse and ceaseless regret have entered my inmost soul pardon me father said de valette if i have unconsciously awakened thoughts which time perchance had well nigh soothed into forgetfulness awakened thoughts the priest repeated in a melancholy voice they can never never sleep repentance cannot obliterate them years of penance fastings and vigils and wanderings cannot wear them from my remembrance look at me my son and may this decaying frame which time might yet have spared teach thee the vanity of human hopes and lead thee to resist the impulses of passion and to mistrust and regulate even the virtuous inclinations of thy heart your words will be long remembered father said de valette touched by the sorrow of the venerable man and may the good saints restore peace and hope to your wounded spirit and may heaven bless you my son and preserve you from those fatal errors which have wrecked my peace and withered the fairest hopes that ever blossomed on the tree of earthly happiness go now he added in a firmer tone forget this interview if possible and when we meet again think not of what you have now heard and witnessed but see in me only the humble missionary of the church who till this day his voice again trembled till she crossed my path she interrupted de valette do you mean mademoiselle de courcy de courcy repeated the priest grasping the arm of eustace while the paleness of death overspread his features who bears that most unhappy name the niece of mad de la tour returned de valette and however unfortunate the name it has as yet entailed no evil on its present possessor was it she whom i just now saw with you asked the priest with increasing agitation it was and pardon me father your vehemence has already greatly alarmed her i meant it not he replied but i will not meet her again no i dare not look again upon that face has she parents young man he continued after a brief pause she has been an orphan from infancy replied de valette and mad de la tour is almost the only relative whom she claims on earth she is a protestant said father gilbert inquiringly she is said de valette though her parents i have heard were catholics and lucie has herself told me that in her early childhood she was instructed in that faith lucie muttered the priest to himself as if unconscious of another s presence and that name too but no she was not left among the enemies of our faith it is a strange an idle dream he covered his face with his hands and remained several moments apparently in deep musing and when he again looked up every trace of emotion was gone though a shade of melancholy deeper even than usual had settled on his features go he said to de valette and betray not the weakness you have witnessed go in peace and forget even to pity me father gilbert s manner was too imposing to be disputed and de valette left him with silent reverence perplexed by the mystery of his words and the singularity of his conduct before he reached the house however he had convinced himself that the priest was not perfectly sane and that some fancied resemblance had touched the chords of memory and revived the fading images of early and perhaps unhappy days this appeared to him the only rational way to account for his eccentricity and under this impression as well as from the priest s injunction he resolved not to mention the interview and conversation to any person he was particularly anxious to conceal it from lucie whose apprehensions might be increased by the account and in a short time indeed with the lightness of an unreflecting disposition a circumstance which had at the
the lamp that hugh crombie held but dimly enlightened them and the number and contiguity of the doors caused dr melmoth to lay his hand upon the wrong one not there not there doctor it is dame crombie s bedchamber shouted hugh most energetically now beelzebub defend me he muttered to himself perceiving that his exclamation had been a moment too late heavens what do i see ejaculated dr melmoth lifting his hands and starting back from the entrance of the room the three students pressed forward mrs crombie and the servant girl had been drawn to the spot by the sound of hugh s voice and all their wondering eyes were fixed on poor ellen langton the apartment in the midst of which she stood was dimly lighted by a solitary candle at the farther extremity but ellen was exposed to the glare of the three lamps held by hugh his wife and the servant girl their combined rays seemed to form a focus exactly at the point where they reached her and the beholders had any been sufficiently calm might have watched her features in their agitated workings and frequent change of expression as perfectly as by the broad light of day terror had at first blanched her as white as a lily or as a marble statue which for a moment she resembled as she stood motionless in the centre of the room shame next bore sway and her blushing countenance covered by her slender white fingers might fantastically be compared to a variegated rose with its alternate stripes of white and red the next instant a sense of her pure and innocent intentions gave her strength and courage and her attitude and look had now something of pride and dignity these however in their turn gave way for edward walcott pressed forward and attempted to address her ellen ellen he said in an agitated and quivering whisper but what was to follow cannot be known for his emotion checked his utterance his tone and look however again overcame ellen langton and she burst into tears fanshawe advanced and took edward s arm she has been deceived he whispered she is innocent you are unworthy of her if you doubt it why do you interfere sir demanded edward whose passions thoroughly excited would willingly have wreaked themselves on any one what right have you to speak of her innocence perhaps he continued an undefined and ridiculous suspicion arising in his mind perhaps you are acquainted with her intentions perhaps you are the deceiver fanshawe s temper was not naturally of the meekest character and having had a thousand bitter feelings of his own to overcome before he could attempt to console edward this rude repulse had almost aroused him to fierceness but his pride of which a more moderate degree would have had a less peaceable effect came to his assistance and he turned calmly and contemptuously away ellen in the mean time had been restored to some degree of composure to this effect a feeling of pique against edward walcott had contributed she had distinguished his voice in the neighboring apartment had heard his mirth and wild laughter without being aware of the state of feeling that produced them she had supposed that the terms on which they parted in the morning which had been very grievous to herself would have produced a corresponding sadness in him but while she sat in loneliness and in tears her bosom distracted by a thousand anxieties and sorrows of many of which edward was the object his reckless gayety had seemed to prove the slight regard in which he held her after the first outbreak of emotion therefore she called up her pride of which on proper occasions she had a reasonable share and sustained his upbraiding glance with a passive composure which women have more readily at command than men dr melmoth s surprise had during this time kept him silent and inactive he gazed alternately from one to another of those who stood around him as if to seek some explanation of so strange an event but the faces of all were as perplexed as his own even hugh crombie had assumed a look of speechless wonder speechless because his imagination prolific as it was could not supply a plausible falsehood ellen dearest child at length said the doctor what is the meaning of this ellen endeavored to reply but as her composure was merely external she was unable to render her words audible fanshawe spoke in a low voice to dr melmoth who appeared grateful for his advice true it will be the better way he replied my wits are utterly confounded or i should not have remained thus long come my dear child he continued advancing to ellen and taking her hand let us return home and defer the explanation till the morrow there there only dry your eyes and we will say no more about it and that will be your wisest way old gentleman muttered hugh crombie ellen at first exhibited but little desire or rather an evident reluctance to accompany her guardian she hung back while her glance passed almost imperceptibly over the faces that gazed so eagerly at her but the one she sought was not visible among them she had no alternative and suffered herself to be led from the inn edward walcott alone remained behind the most wretched being at least such was his own opinion that breathed the vital air he felt a sinking and sickness of the heart and alternately a feverish frenzy neither of which his short and cloudless existence had heretofore occasioned him to experience he was jealous of he knew not whom and he knew not what he was ungenerous enough to believe that ellen his pure and lovely ellen had degraded herself though from what motive or by whose agency he could not conjecture when dr melmoth had taken her in charge edward
for a moment to pass over the brow of mrs mason a paleness as of death and a burst of tears from the daughter showed the light in which she considered the most distant prospect of getting rid of their difficulties in that way it was settled that they would deliberate no further upon the subject until future difficulties called upon them to act chapter v despise not the poor because he is poor whenever the question of the future course of the family was in discussion and whenever the investigation was followed by gloom and despondency george never failed to ply his father s motto and to dwell upon his last declaration that god never forsakes them who do not forsake themselves they were in health he said and in a country where sustenance was easy to be procured and if they could only hit upon the right way some one might surely be devised in which they might become independent of hercules pindall and every body and take care of themselves the grand burden of their conversations was to search for this way the inquirer after the secret of perpetual motion the chemist inquiring after the transmuting secret that will turn lead to gold the student whipping up his powers to put the finish to an invention that will bring him fame and fortune know but little of the heart wearing study of this family to start in some track by which they might obtain sufficient money to clothe the family and pay the doctor s bill and the taxes destitute as they were these bills were presented and payment pressed with persevering importunity in discoursing every evening upon this theme madam mason george and eliza were of course the chief speakers though henry thomas and william often made their speech and threw their light upon the subject these discussions were pursued with the more earnestness and interest inasmuch as the speakers considered themselves urged to these inquiries by the mournful consideration that in so doing they were fulfilling the last wish and charge of their deceased head his spirit was considered as one of the number still pressing the grand maxim of his life never to despond and urging them to task their inventive powers to the utmost to find some branch of industry in pursuing which they might obtain a decent livelihood if the reader would not have felt a smile out of place in this family he could not have restrained a smile at hearing some of the propositions of the junior members of this singular debating society henry proposed the mystery of bird catching and sending cages of mocking birds red birds parroquets and turtle doves to new orleans for sale thomas was for applying their exertions to the gathering reed canes and sending them to the northern manufacturers for weavers sleys george had high hopes from a chemical composition for ink and blacking which he expected to complete from the vegetables of the country mrs mason and eliza limited their projects to the tried and simple experiment of raising cotton and spinning night and day to clothe themselves and manufacture a little surplus for sale a thousand inconveniences attended every experiment as preliminary difficulties the proposer was generally overwhelmed by the objections of the next speaker one project was abandoned to find difficulties equally insuperable appended to another night after night and week after week wore away in the unprofitable speculations of theory the debating society generally retired from the evening fire to their beds their brain dry and exhausted by useless reaching for some practicable project and their hearts sunk with the discouraging impression that nothing was before them but the same hopeless poverty but when their supper of milk corn bread and sweet potatoes was finished and they were again assembled about the evening fire the repetition of the ancient maxim never despair like a voice from heaven renewed their courage and strength for a new discussion success as it ought ultimately attended these counsels the post master on the bank of the river had noticed george and had inquired into the circumstances and character of the family he was a man who had both understanding and a heart he never it is true had proposed to himself to be a mecnas or to establish a manufacturing village but if we could know all the good thoughts that pass in the minds of humble and undistinguished people who expect neither notoriety nor advantage from those thoughts we could not but think better of the species and human nature while this family was wearying itself in fruitless attempts to invent some kind of pursuit in which to employ their industry he had more than once been occupied in the benevolent desire to be useful to them as a foretaste of good will to them he was in the habit of sending george the newspapers and pamphlets that came to his office after he had perused them these were beneficial to them in a hundred ways they taught the children to read in an imperfect degree they supplied the want of books they learned from them the events passions and employments of the great world the thousand projects and discoveries of manufacturing inventiveness were brought to their view they could thus trace the range of other minds in the same inquiries which themselves were pursuing with so much interest among other inventions in manufactures they noted with keen interest that the town from which they had emigrated had become famous for the manufacture of a new kind of grass bonners in imitation of leghorn straw a premium of fifty dollars had been obtained by a school mate of eliza s for a bonnet of this kind which had sold for thirty dollars beside eighty dollars for a single bonnet and that made by a girl neither older nor more ingenious than herself in fact the whole family from constantly seeing the manufacture going
were exceedingly imprudent to make such engagements do not however delay any longer the explanation of this mystery you know then mother continued lucy with a slight embarrassment in her manner jane s home is situated so far out of the village that the path through the woods is almost as direct as this i have always chosen it because it is far more quiet and pleasant i mean always till of late and why have you abandoned it of late said her mother because i had reason to believe it was a favorite place of resort to the gentleman we were speaking of i had twice met him there as i supposed by accident but jane grant soon after found in our little bower a copy of french verses which i knew he must have dropped and i cannot think it was entirely accidental for my own name was upon them and what were they said mrs everett hastily could you read them lucy i could and i rejoiced for once that jane knew nothing of the language in which they were written the words were beautiful but they were not true for they spoke of a being as sinless and lovely as the angels of heaven and gave to it the name of a frail and erring mortal until last evening i have never since walked through the woods and why did you then jane was to accompany me part of the way and she insisted upon taking the forest path i dared not tell her my scruples neither did i think it at all probable that at this hour i should again meet the stranger jane parted with me on the chestnut knoll and just as she was quite hidden from sight among the trees on turning my head to the little arbor we had fitted up for our own accommodation i beheld the stranger himself he was standing just in the edge of it it was the third time we had met precisely in the same place i would have turned but i saw that his eye was upon me and knew myself to be just in the center of the woods so i moved on with a quickened pace without once averting my eye from the path until i had nearly reached the edge of the thicket being exceedingly fatigued i now began to move slower and it was well that i did for some time i had perceived before me a singular object lying a little on one side of the path as i drew near my curiosity increased and i was turning aside a moment to satisfy it when a slight movement in the adjoining bushes arrested my steps do you wonder dear mother that my blood ran cold with horror when i found myself standing within a few feet of a sleeping indian a warrior too and armed with tomahawk and arrows mrs everett threw her arm around her child as if seeking to protect her from the threatened danger why did you not tell me this before we must go home lucy she coutinued it is no time to be walking now and she drew her daughter s arm in her s as they moved hastily towards the gate of the cottage it was quite dark when they had reached the porch and it was not until mrs everett had closely locked and barred the outer door that lucy found opportunity to renew her narrative i was just hesitating what to do she continued in reply to her mother s inquiries when the sound of distant voices met my ear they seemed rapidly approaching retreat was impossible if they were foes my only security lay in concealment mother have you ever noticed the hollow oak that stands to the right of the path just as you enter the valley of wild flowers yes yes go on said mrs everett with impatience it was only a few rods behind me continued lucy and i was soon concealed within it the voices had all the time been approaching and were now so near that i could distinctly distinguish their words i was surprised too to perceive that they spoke in french and who were they lucy and what did they say inquired mrs everett whose interest in the narrative had every moment increased who they were mother i do not know replied lucy but as to their words i remember them as distinctly as though i had but this moment heard them hertel de rouville said the first voice he is a noble and gallant youth we should be well convinced that he is a traitor ere we come to such desperate measures and what do you call noble and gallant exclaimed the other and rougher tone if to betray to the enemy the counsels of his party is noble i grant you that he is so if to fold up his arms and sit down in the camp of the foe is gallant i grant you he is a gallant youth but de rouville continued the first voice what proof have you that he has betrayed our counsels i thought that vandreuil himself despatched him to the enemy as a spy not as a traitor replied the other his orders were to go from one end of new england to the other to seek its weak and defenceless points of attack to reconnoitre its strong places and see where the ambushed foe might best hide themselves and vandreuil is informed that he lingers here to obtain an opportunity of opening our plans to the governor at all events he continued in a lower tone vandreuil assures me that a little of this same gallant s blood will contribute materially to the betterment of our cause that is if secretly drawn and hertel de rouville is not the man who hesitates at his bidding but if you have any scruples beaumont he added
let it not if it lives curse the mother for the boon of a life which its fellows must despise and speak of with scorn and ignominy i stood even this appeal my heart was steeled within me and though i spoke to her less harshly i spoke as hypocritically as ever she saw through the thin veil which i had deemed it necessary to throw over my dishonesty and a new expression took the place of tenderness in her features it is all true then as they have said she exclaimed passionately now o god do i feel my infirmity now do i know my sin and this is the creature i have loved this is the thing wanting in the heart to feel and mean enough in soul to utter falsehood and prevaricate this is the creature for whom i have sacrificed my heart for whom i have given up hopelessly and haplessly my own soul oh wretched fool oh miserable most miserable folly yet think not and as she turned upon me she looked like the priestess upon the tripod influenced with inspiration think not mean traitor as thou art think not to triumph in thy farther seduction me thou hast destroyed i am thy victim and i feel the doom already but thou shalt go no farther in thy way i will seek out this lady for whose more attractive person mine and my honor and affections alike are to be sacrificed she shall hear from me all the truth she shall know whether it be compatible with her honor and happiness or the dignity of her character to unite herself in such bonds with a man who has proved so deadly so dishonorable to her sex and oh god she exclaimed sinking fervently on her knee if it shall so happen that i save one such as i from such a folly as mine may it not expiate in thy sight some portion of the sad offence of which i have been guilty she rose firmly and without a tear her eyes were red her cheeks were burning with the fever of her whole frame and she seemed in all respects the embodiment of a divine a glorious inspiration i was awed i was alarmed i had never before seen her exhibit any thing like daring or firmness of purpose she was now the striking personification of both she approached and sought to pass by me i seized her hand she withdrew it quickly and indignantly begone she exclaimed i scorn i despise you think not to keep me back you have brought death and shame among my people in devoting me to both you shall pollute me no more nay speak not no more falsehood no more falsehood for your own soul s sake i would not that you should seem meaner in my sight than you already are i seized her hand and retained it by a fierce grasp emily i exclaimed what would you do why is this i ask but for delay give me but a month and all will be well you shall then have what you ask you shall then be satisfied false false these assurances sir deceive me not now they deceive me no more my hope is gone forever gone that you will do me justice i see through your hypocrisy i know all your villainy and constance claiborne shall know it too ha do you start when her name is but mentioned think you i know it not all know i not that you have been bought with money that vile and mercenary as you are you have not only sold me and this unborn pledge of your dishonesty and my dishonor but you have sold yourself seek not to keep me back she shall hear it all from these lips that thenceafter shall forever more be silent she struggled to free herself from my grasp and endeavored to pass by me with a desperate effort her strength was opposed to mine and in the heat of the struggle i forgot that victory in such a contest would be the heaviest shame yet i only sought at first to arrest her progress as i live i had then no other object beyond i certainly did not intend violence far less further crime but the fate was upon me she persisted in her design and in the effort to prevent her passage i hurled her to the ground i paused in a deadly stupor after this i was no longer a reasoning a conscious being she looked up to me imploringly the desperate feeling which heretofore had nerved and strengthened her seemed utterly to have departed the tears were in her eyes and at that moment she would have obeyed as i commanded she would have yielded to all my requisitions she would have been my slave she met no answering gentleness in my eyes and with a choking and vain effort at speech she turned her face despairingly upon the still dewy grass and sobbed as if the strings of her heart were breaking in unison with each convulsion of her breast at that moment i know not what demon possessed me there was a dead a more than customary silence in all things around me i felt a fury within me a clamorous anxiety about my heart a gnawing something that would not sleep and could not be silent and without a thought of what i was to do or what had been done i knelt down beside her my eyes wandered wildly around the forest but at length invariably settled in the end upon her there was an instinct in all this she had the look of an enemy to the secret and impelling nature within me and without uttering a single word my fingers with an infernal gripe were upon her throat she could not now doubt the desperate character of my design
the house of skulls was indeed menacing that enormous pyramid which don amador had surveyed with awe in the gloom of evening was now concealed under a more impressive veil it was invested and darkened by a cloud of human beings which surged over its vast summit and rolled along its huge sides like a living storm the great court that surrounded it was also filled with barbarians for though the coatepantli or wall of serpents with its monstrous battlements and gloomy towers concealed them from the eye there came such a hum of voices from behind as could not have been produced alone even by the myriads that covered the temple in addition to these the great square itself was alive with mexicans and the sudden sight of them brought a thrill of alarm into the heart of the bravest cavalier the people of tenochtitlan thus as it were hunted by their invaders even to their sanctuaries turned upon them with frowns yet parted away from before them in deep silence nevertheless at this spectacle the christians came to an immediate stand in doubt whether to entangle themselves further or to take counsel of their fears and retreat without delay to their quarters while they stood yet hesitating and in some confusion suddenly and with a tone that pierced to their inmost souls there came a horrid shriek from the top of the pyramid and fifty castilian voices exclaimed a sacrifice a human sacrifice and under the cross of christ that we raised on the temple the place of god is defiled by the rites of hell cried cortes furiously his apprehensions vanishing at once before his fanaticism set on and avenge couch your lances draw your swords and if any resist call on god and slay so saying he drew his sword spurred his dun steed and rushed towards the temple the half naked herds fled yelling away from the infuriated christian opening him a free path to the walls and had that fearful cry been repeated there is no doubt he would have led his followers even within the coatepantli though at the risk of irretrievable and universal destruction before however he had yet reached the wall he had time for reflection and though greatly excited he could no longer conceal from himself the consequences of provoking the pagans at their very temple and during the worship of their god he was at this moment well befriended and numerously indeed but at a distance from the garrison without cannon and almost without musketry surrounded by enemies whom the eye could not number and who had not feared to assail him even when fortified in a situation almost impregnable and assisted by three times his present force as well as several thousand bold tlascalans and in addition to all these disadvantages there came neither such sound of trumpet nor such distant commotion among the indians as might admonish him of the approach of sandoval he checked his horse and waving to his followers to halt again cast his eyes around on the multitude as if to determine in what manner to begin his retreat for he felt that this measure could be no longer delayed the mexicans gazed upon him with angry visages but still in silence not an arm was yet raised and they seemed prepared to give him passage whichever way he might choose to direct his course while hesitating an instant don hernan perceived a stir among the crowds close under the wall of serpents accompanied by a low but general murmur of voices and immediately the eyes of the pagans were turned from him towards the coatepantli as if to catch a view of some sight still more attractive and important his first thought was that these movements indicated the sudden presence of sandoval and his party a conceit that was however immediately put to flight by the events which ensued the murmurs of the multitude were soon stilled and the pagans that covered the pyramid were seen to cast their eyes earnestly down to the square as the sound of many flutes and other soft wind instruments rose on the air and crept not unmusically along the wall of serpents and thence to the ears of the spaniards before these had yet time to express their wonder at the presence of such peaceful music amidst a scene of war and sacrifice the crowds slowly parted asunder and they plainly beheld for the mexicans had opened a wide vista to the principal gate a procession seemingly of little children clad in white garments waving pots of incense conducted by priests in gowns of black and flame colour and headed by musicians and men bearing little flags issue from the throng and bend their steps towards the savage portal in the centre of the train on a sort of litter very rich and gorgeous borne on men s shoulders and sheltered by a royal canopy of green and crimson feathers stood a figure which might have been some maiden princess arrayed for the festival or as she seemed to one or two of the more superstitious castilians some fiendish goddess conjured up by the diabolical arts of the priests to add the inspiration of her presence to the wild fury of her adorers she stood erect her body concealed in long flowing vestments of white on which were embroidered serpents of some green material in her hand she held a rod imitative of the same reptile and on her forehead was a coronet of feathers surrounding what seemed a knot of little snakes writhing round a star or sun of burnished gold as this fair apparition was carried through their ranks between the great wall and the house of skulls the mexicans were seen to throw themselves reverently on the earth as if to a divinity and those that stood most remote no sooner beheld her than they bowed their heads with the deepest humility
of death prevailed throughout the chapel respiration and reflection itself seemed suspended upon the awful announcement of the recluse while he fell back upon one of the seats of the aisle and covered his face with his hands in unutterable anguish mrs fairfax had been visibly agitated from the first moment of this startling interruption by some more dreadful emotion than the surprise and vague alarm of those about her but now desperation itself nerved her sinking powers as she stepped a pace forward and uttered in a distinct voice it is false proceed with the ceremony harrison and dudley instinctively felt for their arms the former exclaiming he is mad staring mad be it our business to prevent this irreverent interruption but the recluse immediately sprung upon his feet throwing his mask upon the floor as he stood full in front of mrs fairfax and exclaimed pointing with his index finger to his time worn countenance look thou upon these long forgotten lineaments and then upon these laying his hand upon bacon s head and testify before heaven and earth whether i have not spoken truth a fearful truth the person appealed to stood for some moments like a statue her eyes protruding from their sockets as if a tenant of the grave indeed stood before her her hand at length slowly rose from her side and wandered through the vacant air as if she would have submitted the spectre to the test of feeling imperfectly measuring the distance however between her own person and the object sought it fell again powerless by her side her lips moved as if she were in the act of holding a conversation with the being who had addressed her but no sound issued from them the pupils of her eyes were painfully distended and their whole expression wild and bewildered at length her chest began to heave convulsively when she made a wild and desperate effort to rush upon the object of her gaze but fell prostrate on the floor before she had attained half the distance between them as she fell she cried in the most piteous accents charles charles and then swooned away charles dudley who had till now assisted bacon in supporting his fainting bride resigned his charge to mr harrison and ran to mrs fairfax supposing himself to be the person thus piteously apostrophized he took the fallen lady in his arms and raised her partly from the floor but no symptoms of returning animation were visible while he thus supported her head upon one knee kneeling upon the other assisted by the clergyman and friends and bacon and mr harrison supporting virginia who was in little better condition a tumultuous crowd rushed in at the door headed by sir william berkley himself exclaiming to his minions tear him from the altar tear the upstart from the altar but as he ran with his drawn sword towards the pulpit something in the attitude and expression of the various parties at once arrested his hand and voice there is a power of expression in deep and irremediable sorrow which cannot be looked upon without emotion boisterous and outrageous as sir william berkley had entered the chapel his fierce nature was instantly subdued by the appearance of his sister in law and her daughter the crowd which followed were instinctively awed into silence by the same powerful and speaking appeals when the announcement of the lawful cause which prevented the consummation of the union first fell upon bacon s ear his head sank upon his breast and although he mechanically clasped virginia round the waist as he felt her clinging to him and sinking at his side he stood stupefied with horror holding up his lifeless burden entirely enable to think or act his habitual and superstitious reverence for every thing uttered by the recluse induced him to receive the first impression of his words unchallenged even in his own mind by the time that sir william berkley and his party arrived the recluse had disappeared every one was so much absorbed by the instant and pressing calls for assistance and sympathy from the suffering females that the time of his departure was entirely unnoticed the governor had no sooner recovered from his first shock and surprise than he made his way to one of the young harrisons to learn the cause of the present appearance of the parties so different from what he had been taught to expect although he did not believe that there was one word of truth in the cause assigned for the interruption of the ceremony he was well enough satisfied that the parties themselves and mrs fairfax should believe it no matter to him what horrors they suffered he considered it all but a just punishment for their attempted mesalliance as for bacon and his horror stricken feelings sir william did not deign to bestow a thought or word upon them after the first hasty exclamation with which he had entered the door by his orders the female sufferers were placed in a carriage and removed to his own house bacon resigned his charge with a listless apathy bordering on stupefaction and to a superficial observer such would doubtless have been the impression but his was the deadly deceitful calm which precedes the coming storm the most horrible of all human sufferings is that where no tear is or can be shed where no enemy presents himself for vengeance no hope for the future all having been perilled and lost upon a single throw bacon felt himself thus situated the cherished hopes of a lifetime were blasted in an instant not only for the present but under such circumstances as to cut off all hope for the future the object of his passion could not henceforth be enshrined in a holy secret worship of the soul such as is sometimes kept up through a long life of celibacy for the lost one no mortified
indeed error there be would even in its fallacy approach the benign spirit of that redeemer who looked with pity upon the woes of earth and who said even unto the most abandoned go and sin no more chapter xxvii the verdict midnight scene in a court of justice hark hush be still they come one moment and tis o er it is a mournful thing to turn from the last clinging hope and defence of the accused to the cold severe exaggerating attacks of the prosecution perhaps there never was a case upon a capital offence where the eloquence and ingenuity of the defendant s counsel did not strike out upon the misery of the accused some bright sparks of hope the mass of evidence cannot be borne in mind at once a perception of the truth often requires a series of deliberate and abstruse arguments which the audience never discover or fail to retain amid the confusion of evidence and the instinct of mercy the sight of a criminal too when punishment seems certain softens the heart to pity and prepares it to magnify and dwell upon the grounds of hope an ingenious orator in an artful survey of the case lingers with disproportionate force upon the favourable circumstances and leaves the more unexplainable and condemnatory parts in the shade for a moment the sky of the accused brightens the roaring of the tempest is lulled his half wrecked mind rests as the surrounding sea of doubt and despair closes its yawning abysses and he beholds again the green and sunny shore where safety and bliss await his weary steps ah delusive calm ah treacherous hope an awful pause succeeds the words of mercy and hope dreadful the task of him who has to dissolve this vision the prosecution commenced their duty as their skilful batteries were opened against the victim the brightness passed from his features one after another his hopes melted away the relentless tempest darkened over his head the mad wind began to roar and thunder in the air his broken hulk once more hung on the uplifted and giant wave the distant shore receded from his despairing eyes and he felt that ruin and death again yawned beneath his feet two experienced unfeeling and sagacious lawyers exhausted their powers in demonstrating the guilt of the accused in which they both fully and conscientiously believed germain wove around him the meshes of sophistry and rendered it once more a glaring certainty and the district attorney closed with a startling eloquence the orator allowed the prisoner s apparent good character allowed the horrid spectacle of a youth so formed to adorn society cut off and crushed beneath a fate so terrible but these considerations he said severely were not for the jury box let them deepen the interest of a poem or embellish the pages of a novel but a tribunal of justice had a sterner task than the indulgence of feeling however amiable that the murder had been committed every circumstance proclaimed the ride the disappearance the blood stained handkerchief the hat floating abandoned on the stream the body as far as the testimony of credible witnesses go identified as that of rosalie romain the confusion of the assassin his conduct on the arrest the evidence of the female domestic respecting the demeanour of the unfortunate victim her clandestinely meeting the prisoner at that suspicious hour of the morning every thing as far as human proof could proclaimed the dreadful act and the deep cunning of the prisoner what proof can you demand of murder it is a deed which the perpetrator commits alone he comes not in the broad streets where positive evidence can be produced against him he steals with stealthy pace in darkness and solitude he disguises his intention under smiles and the mask of virtue he plants the dagger in a moment unseen by all by all but his avenging god murder rarely admits evidence stronger than that produced against this man if you acquit him upon the principle of doubt future assassins have only to stab in solitude and they will stab in safety we shall behold shameless seducers and murderers walking among us unwhipped of justice leave crime unpunished and you open the flood gates through which devastation and despair rush in upon the retreats of domestic life the pity which makes you tremble at inflicting a necessary penalty which causes you to yield to the pleadings of compassion and to melt at the sight of guilt bound on the altar to forget law society the claims of the innocent and the just indignation and agony of the bereaved rather than speak the word and strike the blow to which you have pledged your oaths and which great justice demands is a weak an idle a pernicious feeling full of danger and deceit unworthy of fathers citizens men you are the guardians of the community to your hands she has committed her safety and with such a feeling in your bosoms will you betray your trust she has placed you as sentinels on her walls and at her gates do not kneel and admit the foe which you are sent to overcome had the gaunt form of murder stalked in unabashed and unintimidated amid the gayety of your own festive board had your startled eyes suddenly beheld him vanish and lo the brightest seat at the banquet is left vacant had you beheld the demon who had thus bereaved and made you desolate for ever stride unfearing and unabashed through the mid day streets triumphing in his deed and perhaps grown bold by experience meditating to repeat it because forsooth the shrinking sensibilities of a too sentimental jury could not harden their hearts to arrest his career you would feel as you ought to feel on this solemn occasion the hospitality of friendship the rights of society the laws of man and of god have been grossly violated by
calling loudly for relief while those on his left were unemployed terrible was the cursing and clamour and twenty voices at once ordered ned out of the line ned stepped out and along came the man on horseback and ordered him in again captain said ned i am so thirsty that i can do nothing until i get some water and they will not let me drink in the line well said the captain step in and i ll see that you get a drink ned stepped in again and receiving the first bucket began to raise it to his lips very slowly when some one hallooed to him to pass on the bucket and he brought it down again and handed it on why didnt you drink said the captain why dont you see they wont let me said ned dont mind what they say drink and then go on with your work ned took the next bucket and commenced raising it as before when some one again ordered him to pass on the bucket there said ned turning to the captain with the bucket half raised you hear that why blast your eyes said the captain what do you stop for drink on and have done with it ned raised the bucket to his lips and drank or pretended to drink until a horse might have been satisfied aint you done said the captain general mutiny and complaint beginning to prevail in the line why ha nt you drank enough said the captain becoming extremely impatient most said ned letting out a long breath and still holding the bucket near his lips zounds and blood cried the captain clear yourself you ll drink an engineful of water ned left the ranks and went to his lodgings and the rising sun found us on our way homeward hall the fight in the younger days of the republic there lived in the county of two men who were admitted on all hands to be the very best men in the county which in the georgia vocabulary means they could flog any other two men in the county each through many a hard fought battle had acquired the mastery of his own battalion but they lived on opposite sides of the courthouse and in different battalions consequently they were but seldom thrown together when they met however they were always very friendly indeed at their first interview they seemed to conceive a wonderful attachment to each other which rather increased than diminished as they became better acquainted so that but for the circumstance which i am about to mention the question which had been a thousand times asked which is the best man billy stallions stallings or bob durham would probably never have been answered billy ruled the upper battalion and bob the lower the former measured six feet and an inch in his stockings and without a single pound of cumbrous flesh about him weighed a hundred and eighty the latter was an inch shorter than his rival and ten pounds lighter but he was much the most active of the two in running and jumping he had but few equals in the county and in wrestling not one in other respects they were nearly equal both were admirable specimens of human nature in its finest form billy s victories had generally been achieved by the tremendous power of his blows one of which had often proved decisive of his battles bob s by his adroitness in bringing his adversary to the ground this advantage he had never failed to gain at the onset and when gained he never failed to improve it to the defeat of his adversary these points of difference have involved the reader in a doubt as to the probable issue of a contest between them it was not so however with the two battalions neither had the least difficulty in determining the point by the most natural and irresistible deductions priori and though by the same course of reasoning they arrived at directly opposite conclusions neither felt its confidence in the least shaken by this circumstance the upper battalion swore that billy only wanted one lick at him to knock his heart liver and lights out of him and if he got two at him he d knock him into a cocked hat the lower battalion retorted that he wouldnt have time to double his fist before bob would put his head where his feet ought to be and that by the time he hit the ground the meat would fly off his face so quick that people would think it was shook off by the fall these disputes often led to the argumentum ad hominem but with such equality of success on both sides as to leave the main question just where they found it they usually ended however in the common way with a bet and many a quart of old jamaica whiskey had not then supplanted rum were staked upon the issue still greatly to the annoyance of the curious billy and bob continued to be good friends now there happened to reside in the county just alluded to a little fellow by the name of ransy sniffle a sprout of richmond who in his earlier days had fed copiously upon red clay and blackberries this diet had given to ransy a complexion that a corpse would have disdained to own and an abdominal rotundity that was quite unprepossessing long spells of the fever and ague too in ransy s youth had conspired with clay and blackberries to throw him quite out of the order of nature his shoulders were fleshless and elevated his head large and flat his neck slim and translucent and his arms hands fingers and feet were lengthened out of all proportion to the rest of his frame his joints were large and his limbs small and as for flesh he could not with propriety be said to
jenner was a man which in your day was a very different circumstance i verily believe if it had been a woman who brought that happy event about although the whole world would have availed itself of the discovery her name would scarcely be known at this day hastings laughed at his friend s angry defence of women s rights but he could not help acknowledging the truth of what was said there was always a great unwillingness in men to admit the claims of women but it was not a time nor was this the place to discuss so important a subject he intended however to resume it the first leisure moment he turned his eye to the river and saw vessels innumerable coming and going and on the arrival of one a little larger than that which he first saw the crowd pressed forward to get on board as soon as she should land where is that vessel from said hastings she looks more weather beaten than the rest she has been at sea yes that is one of our indiamen let us go to her i see a friend of mine on board he went out as supercargo they went on board of the indiaman and although it had encountered several storms and had met with several accidents yet the crew was all well and the cargo safe the vessel was propelled by the same machinery there was neither masts nor sails how many months have they been on their return said hastings hush said his friend edgar do not let any one hear you why this passage has been a very tedious one and yet it has only occupied four weeks in general twenty days are sufficient well said hastings after this i shall not be surprised at any thing why in my time we considered it as a very agreeable thing if we made a voyage to england in that time have you many india ships yes the trade has been opened to the very walls of china the number of our vessels has greatly increased but you will be astonished to hear that the emperor of china gets his porcelain from france no i am not now that i hear foreigners have access to that mysterious city for i never considered the indian china as at all equal to the french either in texture or workmanship but i presume i have wonders to learn about the chinese yes much more than you imagine it is not more than a century since the change in their system has been effected before that no foreigner was allowed to enter their gates but dissensions among themselves effected what neither external violence nor manoeuvring could do the consequence of this intercourse with foreign nations is that the feet of their women are allowed to grow and they dress now in the european style they import their fashions from france and i see by the papers that the emperor s second son intends to pay this country a visit they have english and french as well as german and spanish schools and a great improvement in the condition of the lower classes of the chinese has taken place but it was first by humanizing the women that these great changes were effected their form of government is fast approaching that of ours but they held out long and obstinately their climate is very much against them observed hastings mental culture must proceed slowly where the heat is so constant and excessive yes but my dear sir you must recollect that they have ice in abundance now we carry on a great trade in that article in fact some of our richest men owe their wealth to the exportation of this luxury alone boston set the example she first sent cargoes of ice to china but it was not until our fast sailing vessels were invented that the thing could be accomplished i should think it almost impossible to transport ice to such a distance even were the time lessened to a month or six weeks as it now is you must recollect that half of this difficulty of transporting ice was lessened by the knowledge that was obtained even in your day of saving ice according to the recorder who sneered at the times for remaining so long ignorant of the fact ice houses could be built above ground with the certainty that they would preserve ice it was the expense of building those deep ice houses which prevented the poor from enjoying this luxury nay necessary article now every landlord builds a stack of ice in the yard and thatches it well with oat straw and the corporation have an immense number of these stacks of ice distributed about the several wards i have awakened in delightful times my friend oh that my family could have been with me when i was buried under the mountain young hastings seeing the melancholy which was creeping over the unfortunate man hurried him away from the wharf and hastened to chestnut street our hero looked anxiously to the right and to the left but all was altered all was strange arcades now took precedence of the ancient inconvenient shops there being one between every square extending from chestnut to market on one side and to walnut on the other intersecting the smaller streets and alleys in their way here alone were goods sold no where else was there a shop seen and what made it delightful was that a fine stream of water ran through pipes under the centre of the pavement bursting up every twenty feet in little jets cooling the air and contributing to health and cleanliness the arcades for the grocers were as well arranged as those for different merchandize and the fountains of water which flowed perpetually in and under their shops dispersed all impure smells and all decayed substances all this is beautiful said hastings but
i could have wished to find in arms against the generous master who so well deserved his grateful devotion i speak of that unfortunate youth whose fault i must not use a harsher term nearly twelve months ago dishonored our common name and parentage your excellency will appreciate the struggle in my bosom between a sense of duty and the foolish but inextinguishable relentings of nature i have determined to put an end to this painful strife and to take security against my own weakness by sending him on immediately to you without awaiting the result of the meditated sortie in the morning he therefore travels in custody of the bearer of this letter under guard of a sergeant and four men having returned to the camp this night after tattoo i am unprepared to give any account of our loss or that of the enemy i have nothing authentic but the lamented death of col mason who fell fighting bravely i beg leave to express an humble hope that your excellency will be pleased to attribute the partial failure of my enterprise to the unfortunate wound which put me hors du combat at a moment up to which we had successfully driven the enemy before us for nearly half a mile and across the river i remain sir with the most profound respect your excellency s most humble and faithful servant owen trevor col th inf a worthy gentleman said the president folding up the letter a most worthy gentleman let any man doubt henceforth if he can that the only way to judge in advance of what a man will do is to ascertain his interest see how readily it settled this nice point of casuistry this delicate question of conflicting duties trust yes i will trust but not as fools do i will trust no man s honor but every man s interest the experience of my whole life has taught the lesson and every day confirms it here comes a new example added he as the door bell sounded and was echoed by the single stroke in the room the door opened and the honorable mr baker appeared his figure had lost nothing of its deferential bend his step nothing of its creeping cautious tread his countenance nothing of its abject servility but there was more of anxiety and less of hope with a slight appearance of peevish dissatisfaction you are very good my dear sir said the president you are always almost present to my wish government would be an easy task ere all officers like you i humbly thank your excellency replied the judge were not your approbation precious to me i might be tempted perhaps to look more than i ought to public opinion perhaps i do so as it is for though my duties are clearly necessary to the good of the state i find it hard to bear the loud reproaches of a misjudging multitude that reach me through a factious press let it not reach you my dear sir the storm does but rage without why need you hear it when it touches you not shut your ears and sleep soundly or open them only to the more pleasant tones that issue from loyal lips i take care not to know what is said of me by malcontent scribblers but i hardly flatter myself that i should preserve my equanimity if i read all that is written it is sometimes impossible not to hear said the judge and there are words which convey reproach which though uttered in a single breath reach the heart i can never i fear make myself proof against such a phrase as judicial murder but you must find consolation in your own enlighted conscience my dear sir some feeling must be expected when the edge of the law falls on victims whose offences demand punishment and yet are such as those the world calls honorable and upright are most likely to commit the misfortune is replied the other that it is only for such offence and on such victims that my office seems to be made to act and when the curse rises up against me loud as well as deep and uttered and echoed on every side i pray your excellency to pardon me when i say that i find its honors and emoluments a poor compensation it will be some relief to you then replied the president that you are like to have a subject of a different sort to act upon one whose crimes offend against the laws of god as well as man and who is not more obnoxious to state policy than to the detestation of all good men and of none more than yourself of whom is your excellency pleased to speak asked mr baker of no other than that young fellow trevor whose ill luck snatched him away from our hands when perhaps he was not quite ripe for punishment but he has since made himself perfect in crime by becoming the leader of a desperate banditti in short he is no other than the famous captain douglas and is now in my power i think you will find in his case a fair set off against some of the mortifications of which you complain and think no more of denying your services to the public at least until he has fulfilled his destiny the effect of this communication on the mind of the honorable gentleman was such as the president had anticipated to every being of the name of trevor he bore a mortal antipathy in the case of douglas this was rendered more intense by the sympathy of a father with a favorite son an envious malignity was a striking feature in the characters both of father and son and this had been provoked to the utmost by that unfortunate young man both were sensible that the younger baker had been in bad odor with the
but the things asserted are not inventions of imagination no person could thus delineate scenes which he had not beheld and therefore maria monk witnessed them consequently she was a member of that family community for the circumstances which she narrates nowhere else occurred at all events it seems more reasonable to suppose that an individual can more certainly tell what had been his own course of life than persons who by their own admission know nothing of the subject and especially when her statements are confirmed by such unexceptionable witnesses there are however two collateral points of evidence which strongly confirm maria monk s direct statements one is derived from the very character of the acknowledgments which she made and the period when they were first disclosed a death bed says the poet is a detector of the heart now it is certain that the appalling facts which she states were not primarily made in a season of hilarity or with any design to make money by them or with any expectation that they would be known to any other person than mr hilliker mr tappan and a few others at bellevue but when there was no anticipation that her life would be prolonged and when agonized with the most dreadful retrospection and prospects it is not possible to believe that any woman would confess those facts which are divulged by maria monk unless from dread of death and the judgment to come or from the effect of profound christian penitence feminine repugnance would be invincible thus the alarm of eternity her entrance upon which appeared to be so immediate was the only cause of those communications which incontestably prove that nunneries are the very nurseries of the most nefarious crimes and the most abandoned transgressors the other consideration is this that admitting the statements to be true maria monk could not be unconscious of the malignity of roman priests and of her own danger and if her statements were fictitious she was doubly involving herself in irreparable disgrace and ruin in either case as long as she was in new york she was personally safe and as her disclosures had been restricted to very few persons she might have withdrawn from the public institution and in privacy have passed away her life alike unknowing and unknown lunacy itself could only have instigated a woman situated as she was to visit montreal and there defy the power and malice and fury of the roman priests and their myrmidons by accumulating upon them charges of rape infanticide the affliction of the tortures of the inquisition and murders of cold blooded ferocity in the highest degree with all the atrocious concomitant iniquities which those prolific sins include now it is certain that she was not deranged and she was not forced she went deliberately and of her own accord to meet the popish priests upon the spot where their crimes are perpetrated and the stronghold of their power whether that measure was the most prudent and politic for herself and the most wise and efficient for the acquisition of the avowed object may be disputed but the exemplary openness and the magnanimous daring of that act cannot be controverted the narrative pages to l respecting the cholera and the election riots at montreal both which scenes happened at the period when dr robertson says maria monk was at william henry or st denis or st ours could not have been described at least that part of it respecting the wax candles and the preparation for defence except by a resident of the nunnery it is a public notorious fact that blessed candles were made and sold by the nuns and used at montreal under the pretext to preserve the houses from the cholera and to drive it away that those candles were directed so to be kept burning by the pretended injunction of the pope and that large quantities of the nunnery candles were dispersed about montreal and its vicinity which were fixed at a high price and whoever suffered by the cholera the nuns and their masters the priests could truly say by this craft we have our wealth acts it is obvious that a young papist woman at service at william henry could know no more of those matters than if she had been at labrador for the incidental remark with which that part of the narrative commences is one of those apparently superfluous intimations which it is evident a person who was writing a fiction would not introduce and yet it is so profoundly characteristic of a canadian convent that its very simple artlessness at once obliterates dr robertson s affidavit there were a few instances and only a few in which we knew any thing that was happening in the world and even then our knowledge did not extend out of the city we cannot be infallibly certain of maria monk s description of the interior of the nunnery but that unpremeditated remark so minutely descriptive of the predominating ignorance among the nuns of all terrestrial concerns exterior of the convent is satisfactory proof that the narrator was not sketching from fancy but depicting from actual life from those testimonies direct and unintentional it is fully evident that maria monk was a long resident and is profoundly acquainted with the doings in the hotel dieu convent at montreal ii what collateral evidence can be adduced of the truth of the awful disclosures by maria monk one corroborative testimony is derived from the silence of the roman priests and their avowed partisans months have passed away since the first statements of those matters were made and also the defence of the priests with the affidavits and other connected circumstances were presented to the public in the protestant vindicator one of the persons in montreal who was in favour of the jesuits mr doucet stated that the priests never take up such things they allow their character to defend
the mind of the spectator some glimmering of doubt as to the reality of the vision before his eyes a degree of hope however feeble that he is the victim of chicanery and that the apparition is not actually a visitant from the old world of shadows it is not too much to say that such remnants of doubt have been at the bottom of almost every such visitation and that the appalling horror which has sometimes been brought about is to be attributed even in the cases most in point and where most suffering has been experienced more to a kind of anticipative horror lest the apparition might possibly be real than to an unwavering belief in its reality but in the present instance it will be seen immediately that in the minds of the mutineers there was not even the shadow of a basis upon which to rest a doubt that the apparition of rogers was indeed a revivification of his disgusting corpse or at least its spiritual image the isolated situation of the brig with its entire inaccessibility on account of the gale confined the apparently possible means of deception within such narrow and definite limits that they must have thought themselves enabled to survey them all at a glance they had now been at sea twenty four days without holding more than a speaking communication with any vessel whatever the whole of the crew too at least all whom they had the most remote reason for suspecting to be on board were assembled in the cabin with the exception of allen the watch and his gigantic stature he was six feet six inches high was too familiar in their eyes to permit the notion that he was the apparition before them to enter their minds even for an instant add to these considerations the awe inspiring nature of the tempest and that of the conversation brought about by peters the deep impression which the loathsomeness of the actual corpse had made in the morning upon the imaginations of the men the excellence of the imitation in my person and the uncertain and wavering light in which they beheld me as the glare of the cabin lantern swinging violently to and fro fell dubiously and fitfully upon my figure and there will be no reason to wonder that the deception had even more than the entire effect which we had anticipated the mate sprang up from the mattress on which he was lying and without uttering a syllable fell back stone dead upon the cabin floor and was hurled to the leeward like a log by a heavy roll of the brig of the remaining seven there were but three who had at first any degree of presence of mind the four others sat for some time rooted apparently to the floor the most pitiable objects of horror and utter despair my eyes ever encountered the only opposition we experienced at all was from the cook john hunt and richard parker but they made but a feeble and irresolute defence the two former were shot instantly by peters and i felled parker with a blow on the head from the pump handle which i had brought with me in the meantime augustus seized one of the muskets lying on the floor and shot another mutineer wilson through the breast there were now but three remaining but by this time they had become aroused from their lethargy and perhaps began to see that a deception had been practised upon them for they fought with great resolution and fury and but for the immense muscular strength of peters might have ultimately got the better of us these three men were jones greely and absolom hicks jones had thrown augustus to the floor stabbed him in several places along the right arm and would no doubt have soon dispatched him as neither peters nor myself could immediately get rid of our own antagonists had it not been for the timely aid of a friend upon whose assistance we surely had never depended this friend was no other than tiger with a low growl he bounded into the cabin at a most critical moment for augustus and throwing himself upon jones pinned him to the floor in an instant my friend however was now too much injured to render us any aid whatever and i was so encumbered with my disguise that i could do but little the dog would not leave his hold upon the throat of jones peters nevertheless was far more than a match for the two men who remained and would no doubt have dispatched them sooner had it not been for the narrow space in which he had to act and the tremendous lurches of the vessel presently he was enabled to get hold of a heavy stool several of which lay about the floor with this he beat out the brains of greely as he was in the act of discharging a musket at me and immediately afterward a roll of the brig throwing him in contact with hicks he seized him by the throat and by dint of sheer strength strangled him instantaneously thus in far less time than i have taken to tell it we found ourselves masters of the brig the only person of our opponents who was left alive was richard parker this man it will be remembered i had knocked down with a blow from the pump handle at the commencement of the attack he now lay motionless by the door of the shattered stateroom but upon peters touching him with his foot he spoke and entreated for mercy his head was only slightly cut and otherwise he had received no injury having been merely stunned by the blow he now got up and for the present we secured his hands behind his back the dog was still growling over jones but upon examination we found him completely dead the
none of those associations that usually lend a fascination to the mysteries of the craft no cave with wild and repulsive entrance concealed her no lofty trees whispered and sighed as she delivered her oracles not a wrinkle was stamped on her brow there was even something of beauty in her regular profile and her large black eyes threw forth a lustrous ray still as we entered her small apartment where one candle glanced with dim and yellow light on the individual who pretended to the awful power of knowing those secrets which belong only to the eternal our laugh was checked and anna s fair cheek was paler than its usual delicate hue she trembled so much that i half regretted her presence i advanced first the woman looked at me with her penetrating eyes and pouring some tea into a cup waved it gently until the grounds were scattered and settled then pouring off the liquid she examined them with an air of deceptive earnestness i believe my whole heart was in my face as i bent eagerly forward to this singular dispenser of destiny what a war of feeling and reason here said she peering at the cup is a young man on horseback and there do you see something shining there and she pointed with a bodkin to the centre of the cup looking full in my eyes see there is a ring and i was silly enough to forget that a young man and a ring would probably be the very first things that a fortuneteller would speak of to a girl of my age and putting my hands to my ears i screamed out no no not another word i will not hear another word while lewis clapped his hands and shouted excellent go on good woman go on but i was resolute i felt as if the walls had ears and eyes and that too much had already been told and sheltered my burning face behind anna now miss anna said lewis as with gentle force he drew her towards the woman how beautiful she was at that moment in the struggle to conquer her reluctance perhaps the contrast of the tall commonplace figure of the fortune teller made her spiritual loveliness more striking she grasped her little fan almost convulsively her eyes shunned the dark orbs that were fixed upon her and as the lips of the fortuneteller uttered a sound she caught lewis s hand and looked up to him beseechingly while tears started to her eyes lewis could trifle no longer he retained her hand throwing at the same time a double douceur to the woman and said earnestly god forbid that my boyish whims should give you a moment s pang and drawing her arm in his he whispered as we descended the steps let me read your fortune sweet trembler and its first and last oracle shall be love love it was the only time he had spoken thus anna was silent through our ride once she sighed so deeply that we started and i felt a warm tear drop on my arm we reached the hall and were separated a while by the dance the next time i saw her her cheek was glowing her eye sparkling her step light as a fay s on a moonbeam and her smile all radiance and joy while lewis stood not dancing with her but gazing on her and she knew that it was so chapter xix country guests a morning walk new trials show not to the poor thy pride let their home a cottage be nor the country dweller hide in a palace fit for thee better far his humble shed humble sheds of neighbours by and the old and scanty bed where he sleeps and hopes to die crabbe i wish your likeness had been taken last night said i to anna as walking through king street on the morning after the ball i glanced at her placid face you will never look again as you did then with that shakspeare expression between tragedy and comedy how could you fit those gloves at madame s store so quietly with lewis at your side if my heart s wishes were in such a train as yours i should have jumped over the counter anna looked at me with an arch expression which seemed to say if you could see down far into my heart you would not find any trying on of gloves there gentle creature why was she not spared for a riper friendship how rich how golden would have been her maturity but heaven calls such spirits to minister at its eternal altar while we of coarser mould are left to struggle with the world when we returned from our walk the servants told us that a cracker man and woman were in the drawing room waiting for papa on reaching the door which was partly open i perceived a tall sallow looking countryman wagoners so called from the snapping of their long whips to stimulate their team with a blue homespun dress which hung loosely about him standing with his hat on his arms akimbo speaking to a young girl almost equally sallow also dressed in homespun with a cracker or cape bonnet of the same material as he addressed her she rose and they stood before one of the small convex mirrors at that time in fashion now susy said he just see what a smart chance smaller it makes us so speaking they walked backwards gazing at their diminishing size exclaiming if that ant despert curous well anyhow that s droll until they nearly fell over anna and me as we entered recovering themselves they nodded at us the man keeping his hat on still i should have been embarrassed had not papa entered and instantly recognising his visiter cordially shook hands with him and who is this said he turning to the
young gentlemen as busily employed as bees in a hive a very little man approached us from the further end of the store jerking his little arms and legs with the precision and ease of an automaton his dress was new and bright and neat mr lummucks introduced me to him he was no other than mr smith davis himself the principal of the firm i was almost struck dumb to see so much importance confined within so small a compass he shook me cordially by the hand and asked mr lummucks if he knew me know him like a book replied mr lummucks mr smith davis shook me by the hand again and said he was very happy to see me he asked me how the times were and offered me a cigar which i took for fear of giving offence but the first opportunity i got i threw it away buy for cash or time he asked i was a little startled at the abruptness of the question but i replied for cash would you like to look at some prints major he asked i am much obliged to you i replied i am very fond of seeing prints with that mr smith davis commenced turning over one piece of calico after another with amazing rapidity there major very desirable article splendid style only two and six we done a first rate business in that article last season cheapest goods in the street before i could make any reply or even guess at the meaning of mr davis s remarks he was called away and mr lummucks stepped up and supplied his place you had better buy em colonel said mr lummucks they will sell like hot cakes but did you say you bought for cash of course i said if i buy at all he took a memorandum book out of his pocket and looked in it for a moment let me see he said franco franco franco what did you say your firm was something and franco or franco and somebody i have no firm i replied o you have nt have nt you all alone hey but i do nt see that i have got your first name down in my tickler my first name is harry i said right yes i remember said mr lummucks making a memorandum and your references colonel who did you say were your references i have no references i replied indeed i know of no one to whom i could refer unless to my father what the old boy in the country my father is in the country i answered seriously not very well pleased to hear my parent called the old boy then you have no city references hey none at all sir i have no friends here except yourself me exclaimed mr lummucks apparently in great amazement oh ah but how much of a bill do you mean to make with us colonel perhaps i may buy a vest pattern i replied if you have got some genteel patterns a vest pattern cried mr lummucks what hav nt you come down for the purpose of buying goods no sir i replied i came to new york to seek for employment and as you had shown me so many kind attentions i thought you would be glad of an opportunity to assist me in finding a situation mr lummucks countenance underwent a very singular change when i announced my reasons for calling on him do you see any thing that looks green in there he said pulling down his eyelid with his forefinger no sir i do not i replied looking very earnestly into his eye nor in there either he said pulling open his other eye nothing at all sir i replied i guess not said mr lummucks and without making me any other answer he turned on his heel and left me reg larly sucked jack asked a young man who had been listening to our conversation do nt mention it said mr lummucks no you do nt said the other mr lummucks walked up to mr smith davis and whispered in his ear a few words upon which that little gentleman turned round and frowned upon me most awfully i was about to demand an explanation of this strange conduct when mr smith davis came up to me and told me he was not a retailer but a jobber and advised me if i wanted to negotiate for a vest pattern to go into chatham street my first impulse was to take mr smith davis up in my arms and give him a good smart cuff on his ears but i restrained my indignation and merely remarked to him that if he was not a retailer he was in a remarkably small way leave my store sir said mr smith davis turning very pale do nt be frightened i said i would not stay in it upon any account and without more ado i did leave it but with feelings very different from those with which i had entered it to meet with such a rebuff upon my first application for assistance was a cruel disappointment to me and i could scarcely refrain from tears i thought of my poor mother and sister and above all of my cousin s prophecy and my heart sunk within me it was not until i had gone to my chamber and given vent to my feelings in a flood of tears that i could regain my self possession and revolve in my mind some other plan of operations i sat opposite to mr lummucks again at dinner but he did not even give me a look of recognition i thought it was well perhaps that i had met at the very outset of life with such an instance of hollow heartedness and deceit as it would learn me forever after to be on my guard in my intercourse
we rode here that if she were of my sex i should say most decidedly that she had fallen in love with you did she v replied miss grattan tremulously and with a blush that might have been detected by the moonbeam indeed i know no one whose good opinion i would rather have but rejoined she with confusion you are jesting with me jesting with you you do me great injustice i suppose you have plenty of tjgie to grow romantic here and really notwithstanding miss fitzhurst s allegations against me i should be surprised if you did not what a beautiful sweep those hills have and look at the graceful windings of that silvery stream stealing away like a great and happy life to be lost in the great ocean yes you might fall in love here have some one who should be the ocean to the river of your thoughts ah exclaimed fanny fitzhufst who had overheard the latter part of this remark remember mr pinckney that you are quoting from a dream a most powerful poet s dream yes miss fitzhurst you have me fairly for that dream tells of two beings the life of one of whom ended in madness and both in misery remember that dream was shaped out like a reality and from a reality it was a foregone conclusion here the party had approached so near the huskers as to be seen distinctly by them this was apparent from the increased and ambitious alacrity with which they worked and the evident effect which they tried to throw into their song when nat the singer saw them coming he did not join the chorus of the last verse but paused longer than usual before he commenced again he was taxing his powers to produce something extemporaneous in honor of the ladies his gifts as an improvisatore were proven by the following verse which he gave forth in his best manner the coon likes corn and we like he wid the possum fat and the nominee o the ladies come do nt you see e m dar their lobely eyes shine like a star o clar de kitchen old folks young folks clar de kitchen old folks young folks old virginny never tire there s poetry and romance for you miss fanny pitzhurst said pinckney with a hearty laugh in intention at least mr howard pinckney rejoined fanny and that when it is good makes the humblest offering praiseworthy true true and truth in this instance is poetry s handmaid wo have the authority of the poets of all time for comparing the ladies eyes to stars they are not only brilliant like the stars but like them they control our destiny at the foot of an oak near the west end of the corn heap not at all satisfied so far with the events of the evening sat pompey he had mingled with the huskers but for a short time after nat commenced his song when complaining that he could not keep time with such a grunter as the singer he withdrew from among them he sat wrapped in an old coat with his back against the tree to keep the cold off and with his feet and part of his person entirely covered with corn husks his wool was amplified into the dimensions of an ancient wig and his hat was cocked a little on one side on the top of it as much from an air of self importance as for the purpose of hearing the conversation of his companion bobby had his hands thrust into the pockets of his pantaloons which were made of the stuff called corduroy and considerably worn the collar of his jacket was turned up and the brim of his hat turned down so as to meet it and keep him as he said as snug as a possum in a gum tree it was not at all cool to any one who was exercising the least but after walking and husking a short time the worthies paused from their labours and sat down when feeling slightly chilled they had resorted to the mode of keeping themselves comfortable which we have described at bobby s feet by way of a footstove towzer his dog was crouching every now and then when the huskers sang remarkably loud towzer would lift his head lazily from his master s feet glance carelessly around and nestle in the corn husks again occasionally bobby would pat him on the head when he would wag his tail and gather himself up closer to his master s person ah exclaimed bobby look out in the moonlight pompey there s miss fanny i forgot cousin peggy told me to ask miss fanny if she would want her at the big house to morrow there s time enough said pompey f master bobby aint that colonel bentley there yes said bobby i believe it is at this point nat ramsay rolled forth his compliment to the ladies pompey jerked his hat over his eyes as he heard it and exclaimed mister bobby now just listen to that nigger he s in liquor now he s in liquor nebriated an he thinks he s taking the shine off of everything to give you a hidear mister bobby of what a fool nigger that nat is i ll tell you you diskiver and observe that one day i driv my young mistress miss fanny over to miss bentleys and i was a setting on my coach box a thinking a great many things i can think my hardest on a coach box in the midst of it here comes nat ramsey black as the driven charcoal toting his big foot right by miss bentley s door between me and the coach and the house but i tell you pompey observed bobby nat ca nt help it if he has such a leg it aint his fault he
saying no rosalia again pardon me i have but one word more and will no longer distress you think no more of this rash avowal there is nothing due to it t was involuntary and one believe me which i could not have made in a moment of reflection for without hope no i should never then have had the presumption to hope forgive it then and if you can forget that i have dared to make so ill a return for the notice with which you have but too much honored me rosalia attempted to speak but her lips moved without sound i ask no answer continued monaldi mournfully i deserve none but rather and let that be my atonement that i leave you and forever no no said rosalia in a voice hardly audible a moment of breathless silence followed while she caught at the back of a chair as if it could impart the strength which she needed to proceed but the sound of her own voice restored her to herself monaldi your frankness can you forgive it i will do more monaldi i will return it she held out her hand to him but her strength failed her and he caught her on his bosom chapter ix within a short lover s age monaldi became a husband and his happiness would now have been complete could he have felt assured that peace was again restored to his friend but maldura had long since disappeared having left his lodgings the day after monaldi s offer nor could the least trace of him be discovered monaldi felt the disappointment the more as he had now persuaded himself that no melancholy however wayward could long withstand the sympathy of his wife maldura s absence was occasioned by a letter from sienna announcing the death of a rich relation and calling him there to take possession of his inheritance a few years back this accession of wealth would have filled him with joy but what is wealth to the crumbled hopes of intellectual ambition it cannot rebuild them maldura received the intelligence without the moving a muscle though it gave no pain it could give no pleasure for he was no sensualist he had never had but one vice the lust of praise which seated in his brain seemed like a voracious reptile to swallow up every thought as soon as born till bloated with overgorging it had left no room for the growth of another to a vice like this money was useless except with a coxcomb but maldura was no coxcomb and he disdained to beg or bribe even for praise yet he notwithstanding took possession of his fortune there was no one on earth whom he loved and there was some satisfaction he thought in possessing that which many wanted he was content to be rich because others were poor having arranged his affairs he now began to consider whither to direct his course he had quitted rome as he believed forever and florence was associated with too many bitter recollections to be thought of again but where to go he knew not for having no longer any object there was nothing to draw him to one place more than another in this state of indecision having one evening strolled into a coffee house a stranger near him mentioned the name of monaldi he thought he had schooled himself to hear it with indifference yet he leaned over his table towards the speaker the stranger was giving an account to a person next him of monaldi s marriage maldura listened with little change of feeling till he heard the name of rosalia landi he could hear no more but starting up rushed out of the house i go to rome said maldura to his servant as soon as he reached home to night sir exclaimed the man staring yes to night business calls me why t is almost dark sir i want not your attendance said maldura impatiently i go alone now see to my portmanteau and order a horse to the door the servant obeyed and maldura was soon on his way it was enough he thought to have been rejected but to be rejected for one whom of all others he most envied and therefore most hated to know that the woman he had once loved and the man he had once almost despised were now as one that they were prosperous and happy that without title rank almost without family they were yet objects of the public gaze of public admiration and that go where he would talk with whom he would he must hear forever of the painter monaldi and his beautiful wife to know all this whilst himself was unknown miserable drove him to madness he uttered no curse he did not weaken by words the deadly purpose which lay at his heart what that was he had not yet defined in any of its particulars even to himself yet he only waited to mature it till he should find a proper instrument to give it action till then he was contented with brooding over its general form and steadily looking forward to its birth in this mood maldura pursued his journey he had now reached radicofani and was slowly moving up the mountain the reins given to his horse his eyes closed and his thoughts busy about the future when a voice before him suddenly commanded him to stop he raised his eyes but it being after nightfall he could only discern the figure of a horseman standing in his path and presenting what he supposed to be a pistol maldura was wholly unprepared for defence for he had quitted sienna in too much haste and was too intent on the object of his journey to think of providing himself with arms besides it is doubtful whether in his present state of mind he would have taken the precaution had it
of the night when he found from a close private examination which he had given me before my admission that my knowledge of the law was quite as good as the greater number of those who apply for admission he was pleased to express his astonishment at my perseverance and delight at my success when too in addition to this he discovered upon a minute inquiry from my employers and others that i was abstemious and indulged in no excesses of any kind his interest in me increased as i thought who had been accustomed to nothing of the sort beyond all reasonable measure and i soon had occasion to perceive that it was no idle curiosity that prompted his consideration and inquiry without my knowledge he paid a visit to my uncle this gentleman i may be permitted here to say had been quite as much surprised as anybody else at my determined prosecution of my studies in spite of the difficulties by which i was surrounded that i was pursuing them while in the mercantile establishment to which i had gone he did not believe and very frequently when i was at his house for i visited the family and sometimes though unfrequently dined with them on a sabbath he jeered me on my progress the wonderful progress as he was pleased to term it which he felt sure i was making with my coke and blackstone while baling blankets or bundling up plains and kerseys this i bore patiently sustained as i was by the proud indomitable spirit within me which assured me of the ultimate triumph which i felt positive would ensue i enjoyed his surprise a surprise that looked something like consternation when the very day of my admission to the bar and after that event i encountered him in the street and in answer to his usual sarcastic inquiry well edward how does the law come on how is sir william blackstone sir edward coke and the rest of the white heads i simply put the parchment into his hands which declared my formal introduction to those venerable gentry why you do nt mean is it possible so you really are admitted a lawyer eh you see sir and that too without any greek well and what good is it to do you to have a profession edward is one thing to get business another yes sir but i take it the profession must be had first one step is gained that much is sure the other i trust will follow in due season true but i still think that the bricklayer would make the more money were money making sir the only object of life perhaps then that would be the most desirable business but oh i forgot the talents the talents are to be considered and after the utterance of this sneer our dialogue as may be supposed did not much longer continue i did not know of the contemplated visit of mr edgerton to my worthy uncle nor of its purpose or i should most assuredly have put my veto upon the measure with all the tenacity of a resentful spirit but this gentleman who was a man of nice sensibility as well as strong good sense readily comprehended a portion of my secret history from what was known to him he easily conceived that my uncle was somewhat of a niggard from the manner in which i had employed myself during my preparation for the bar he thought however that my uncle though unwilling to expend money in the prosecution of a scheme which he did not approve now that the scheme was so far successful as to afford every promise of a reasonable harvest could not do less than come forward to the assistance of one who had shown such a determined disposition to assist himself he was mistaken he little knew the man his interview with my uncle was a short one the parties were already acquainted though not intimately they knew each other as persons of standing in the same community and this made the opening of mr edgerton s business easy i state the tenor of the interview as it came to my knowledge afterward mr clifford he said you have a nephew a young gentleman who has been recently admitted to the bar mr edward clifford the reply with a look of wonder was necessarily affirmative i have had much pleasure continued the other in knowing him for some time he is an intimate of my eldest son and from what has met my eyes sir i should say you are fortunate in having a nephew of so much promise why yes sir i believe he is a clever youth enough was the costive answer he is more than that sir i regard him indeed as a most astonishing young man the very manner in which he has pursued his studies while engaged in the harassing labors of a large wholesale business house of this city alone establishes this fact the cheeks of my uncle reddened the last sentence of mr edgerton was unfortunate for his object it conveyed a tacit reproof which the niggardly conscience of mr clifford readily appropriated and perhaps anticipated he dreaded lest mr edgerton knew all you are probably aware mr edgcrton he replied with equal hesitancy and haste you have heard that edward clifford is an orphan that he has nothing and it was therefore necessary that he should learn to employ himself though it was against my wish sir that he went into a mercantile house there was something suppressed in this a mean evasion for he could not easily have told mr edgcrton without a blush that instead of the mercantile establishment he would have made me a bricklayer s hodman but this it seems edgerton had found out for himself his reply however was calculated to soothe the jealous apprehensions of mr clifford he had an
the way in front could nt escape me unless she undertook to dress up all her male acquaintance in ruffles and false bosoms and let them out through the alley that might do but i guess she is nt up to it since she lost her husband she s gone a little weak in the head and pays an extra cent on the dollar when she is borrowing from mr fyler close these are small gains and slow ones said mr leycraft you might sit on spiders eggs like these for a century and not hatch out a fortune let s have something bold and dashing something where you put in no capital and double it to boot in less than a week something modelled on the farm house affair eh said fyler close leering on his companion significantly will you let that subject alone if you please mr fyler close cried mr leycraft whose countenance darkened and lowered on his companion as he spake we have had talks enough about that cursed house and one too many i wish the title deed was in the right owner s hands you do do you urged mr close pleasantly shall i ask mrs hetty lettuce the market woman when she comes here next to pay the rent or renew her mortgage if she ca nt find him for us perhaps if we paid her well she might relieve us of the property and provide a very gentlemanly owner in our place shall we advertise offer rewards post placards i ve no doubt if the purlieus of the city were well dragged that an heir would turn up stuff fyler close you know well enough that an heir could nt be brought alive off either one of the five continents that could make good his claim and that makes you chuckle so like a fiend mrs lettuce has lost trace of him for more than twenty years has grown fat and lazy borrows money on bond and mortgage and do nt care a straw about the subject where s your grand project all this time interposed fyler close shall we have something new to practice our wits on or shall we rake among our dead schemes for wherewithal to warm our brains with now that you are on that said mr leycraft rapidly surveying the nooks and privacies of the apartment and bestowing a broad glare on the door and windows i say freely and without the lest reserve that my head s a nine pin if i do nt lay a plan before you will make you thrill down to your pocket ends with rapture it s a neat scheme very neat but at the same time mighty magnificent saying this leycraft drew close up to the side of the broker laid their heads close together and bending over the stand he moved his finger slowly in a sort of hieroglyphic over it and tapping his forehead complacently was about to detail his notable plan when a knock was heard at the door which cut short any further communication for the present the knock was repeated a little louder fyler close motioned to his companion who vanished expeditiously down a pair of back stairs into the yard looking anxiously back all the time as if under pursuit and so through the baker s and close snatching from his pocket a well worn hymn book began reciting a most excellent passage of psalmody in a deep and nasal intonation the knock was repeated three or four times before an invitation was given to enter and although the broker glanced over the top of his book as the door opened and discovered his visitor he assumed not to be conscious of the presence of any person whatever but proceeded steadily in fact with rather increased energy in his capital divertisement please sir said the visitor a stout built lady curtsying and advancing timidly a step or two please sir what s to be done about the little mor gage on my grounds sir this question fyler close seemed at first altogether unable to apprehend but when it was repeated accompanied by a slight jingle of silver in the visitor s pocket he started deposited his book open upon the stand as if he wished to resume it at the very earliest convenience looked about him and pensively remarked twitching his whiskers of which there was a dry tuft on either cheek violently poor old man there s no comfort left for you now but psalm singing and class meetings every other evening in the week these are old chairs madam they certainly are mr close very old there s no denying facts answered the huckster this is a dreadful dreary room for an old man to live in again groaned the broker sartain responded the unwary market woman i think in that point to do you justice it s but next better than a family vault saving the death s heads and the smell and now you ask me a poor lonesome man living like death himself as you admit and that can afford to keep no better company than three poor crazy chairs to renew your mortgage at seven per cent why a cannibal with good cannibal feelings would nt ask it mr close on delivery of this speech fell silent and dropped into a profound meditation during which he from time to time looked up and eyed the stout person of the huckster as if he thought it would furnish a most delicate morsel for a carribee but his own method of devouring a victim differed essentially from that adopted by the benighted heathen and he now proceeded to demonstrate his dexterity in his own particular line of manipulation well you shall have it he cried awaking as from an anxious reverie i have considered it your business shall be done mrs lettuce thank you sir thank you sir i am
garb was transformed into the sombre habiliments of the procureur du roi villefort s face wore the look of madness but there was a freezing calmness in his voice as he said edmond dantes count of monte cristo gaze upon the ruin you have made through you i was dragged down from my high position exposed humiliated and deprived of reason but although the mere wreck of my former self i am not utterly powerless as you shall learn to your cost you raised up my infamous son benedetto to be the instrument of my destruction now he shall work yours and avenge his unhappy father the apparition paused sighed deeply and then resumed in a tone of still greater menace count of monte cristo look well to your beloved wife haydee look well to your heroic son esperance look well to your darling daughter zuleika for this night they are in frightful danger look well to your fabulous riches for they are threatened look well to your stately and magnificent palace for already the element that shall devour it is noiselessly and stealthily at work count of monte cristo farewell a heart rending shriek rang in the sleeper s ears a mighty flash dazzled his eyes and with a grim smile upon his pallid countenance villefort vanished monte cristo awoke with a quick start and passed his hand across his forehead as if dazed then he leaped to his feet and glanced breathlessly about him danglars and villefort had been only the idle coinage of his brain but the heart rending shriek the mighty flash they were indeed stern realities the shriek was haydee s and the flash was fire my god cried monte cristo standing for an instant rooted to the spot can it be possible that this dream is the truth after all and that i am even now to feel the vengeance of those two men he sprang into the spacious hall that was as light as day and as he did so the figure of a man rushed by him it was benedetto and in his hand he held a long knife dripping with blood the count turned and pursued him snatching a dagger from a table as he ran at the door leading to the lawn he grasped him firmly by the shoulder and held him murderer he shouted whose blood is that upon your knife the blood of haydee the greek slave hissed benedetto with a glare of ferocious triumph the blood of haydee your wife edmond dantes i am even with you monte cristo struck at the assassin with his dagger but benedetto eluded the blow and raising his own weapon inflicted a frightful gash upon the count s cheek a terrible struggle ensued monte cristo was possessed of wonderful strength and activity but in both these respects the two desperate antagonists seemed fairly matched three times did the count bury his dagger in benedetto s body but though the assassin s blood gushed copiously from his wounds he continued to fight with the utmost determination at length the men grappled in a supreme deadly effort but monte cristo making a false step slipped on the blood spattered marble floor and benedetto with the quickness of thought hurling him backward freed himself and bounding through the open doorway vanished in the darkness beyond the count uttered a groan of despair as he saw haydee s self confessed murderer escape him and staggered to his feet the fierce conflict with benedetto had exhausted him and he stood for an instant panting and breathless the shrieks had now grown fainter and the hall was full of smoke during all this time neither ali nor any of the servants under him had appeared a circumstance that to monte cristo seemed inexplicable he however did not pause to give it thought but dashed up the stairway and strove to reach his wife s apartment blinding stifling clouds of smoke through which penetrated the glare of the conflagration drove him back again and again but he renewed his attempts to force a passage with undaunted energy and courage finally compressing his lips and holding his nostrils with the thumb and forefinger of his right hand he gave a headlong plunge and succeeded in reaching haydee s door it was open displaying a scene that caused the count s heart to sink within him the whole chamber was one sea of flame fiery tongues like so many writhing and hissing serpents were licking and consuming the costly tapestry the richly carved furniture and the magnificent objects of art the curtains of the bed were blazing and upon the couch lay the senseless form of the wife of monte cristo the pallor of her faultless countenance contrasting painfully with the ruddy glow of the devouring element in haydee s breast was a gaping wound from which her life blood was slowly oozing in ruby drops rendered utterly reckless by the terrible sight the count madly rushed to the couch tore his beloved haydee from it and clasping her tightly against his bosom staggered into the corridor with his precious burden there the smoke had increased in volume and density but summoning all his resolution and endurance to his aid he plunged through it and finally was successful in reaching the library then with the swiftness of a flash of lightning the husband was replaced by the father and monte cristo for the first time since haydee s shrieks had awakened him from his dream thought of his children where were they and what had happened to them the count felt a cold perspiration break out upon his forehead and a feeling of unspeakable dread took entire possession of him haydee demanded immediate attention but esperance and zuleika must instantly be found and rescued at the top of his voice monte cristo shouted for ali but no reply was returned fearing to leave haydee for even a moment the count
allow it after you have proved first that she is your daughter and then that she is not of an age when she is privileged to be her own mistress that would cause delay undoubtedly but i think it will be enough for me to assure her that you have the legal power of compulsion and for you to threaten its employment unless she will go with you at once rather than submit to an indignity when she finds that resistance is useless she will consent to accompany you peaceably we will see if you are right but tell me augusta what are your future plans in regard to this girl if she marries she shall marry a man who is not ashamed to take her old mother by the hand if she remains single i mean to make an actress of her she has a fine person and a good voice i think she would succeed on the stage admirably exclaimed glenham his features brightening with obvious satisfaction the girl has talents and would unquestionably make a hit on the stage she might attain a more advantageous position than any matrimonial alliance could give her besides if she married fleetwood after the effervescence of passion began to subside he would reflect with dismay and regret upon the step he had taken in uniting himself with your family he would begin by ill treating you and end by ill treating his wife then he shall not have my daughter i am resolved on that and now let us see if we can induce adelaide to return with me quietly to the city she rang the bell and directed the servant to inform miss adelaide that her mother wished to see her in the parlor immediately chapter ix good night ah no the hour is ill which severs those it should unite let us remain together still then it will be good night shelley the second morning after the party at mr dryman s fleetwood sat in the parlor of his hotel over a cup of coffee and an omelette scanning the newspapers which had been brought in withhis breakfast as he glanced carelessly along the columns for some paragraph of interest his attention was slightly awakened by one promising to give some account of recent movements in the fashionable world after listlessly perusing a few lines he found that it contained a sketch of the party of the night before he read on and remarked his name conspicuous among those of others who were present the following was the passage in which it occurred the entrance of mr fleetwood of fleetwood was the signal for a general levelling of quizzing glasses on the part of the ladies this young man by the death of both his parents without other issue was left at an early age the inheritor of a large and princely estate including the noble place on the banks of the hudson well known by the family name he is good looking but said to be eccentric and peculiar in his habits and notions of life he was no proof however against the charms of miss emily g who in spite of the frowns and evident anger of count la salle received her new admirer with unequivocal marks of favor was it merely to encourage another moth to singe its wings in the candle flame one would think that the young lady had numbered victims enough both in europe and in this country she has received offers without number from the most eligible men in society fleet wood is certainly a formidable competitor but he had better look out pshaw muttered fleetwood throwing aside the newspaper with disdain and sipping his coffee as if to take out the taste of the paragraph what license these pickers up of unconsidered trifles for the public maw assume with a man s name and character should this impertinent tittle tattle fall under adelaide s eye i am sure she will prize it at its worth re assured by this conviction fleetwood attacked the omelette until there was little left of its fair proportions he suddenly paused and set down his knife and fork and next saturday soliloquized he i shall be a married man have i been hasty in taking this step have i been inconsiderate ah no adelaide is purity itself and did i need an excuse for our immediate union surely the circumstance of her present position would be enough but is it pity that has any weight in urging me to this consummation tell me my heart is it pity no no is not adelaide my equal perhaps my superior in every respect save those of birth and fortune it is love and love only that impels me yes adelaide thou art the first and shalt be the last for whose sake that passion has been awakened in my soul nor time nor accident shall dim its ever full and radiant flame it is something of a bathos to descend from a rhapsody like this to bread and butter but as a candid chronicler i must confess that fleetwood having uttered it did take up a piece of toast and finish his breakfast like a man with a good appetite he had hardly done this when a servant threw open the door and announced mr gordon show him up said fleetwood the individual who entered was a fine specimen of a well preserved gentleman about town his features though a little sunken about the cheeks were still handsome his hair was slightly grizzled about the ears and a keen pair of gray eyes lent animation to his face his figure was erect and tall he was dressed in unexceptionable taste and there was an air of elegance about him which gave the assurance that there was no circle of gentlemen in which he would not have been perfectly at his ease he entered the room with a free
am no apparition sir exclaimed the stranger in a voice so finely modulated that it might have been easily taken for a woman s but a substantial specimen of vigorous life who kindly bids you welcome to the pirates palace and who then are you exclaimed the undaunted earl altering his voice to a deep rough tone the stranger smiled sardonically upon the group before him as he answered i am blackbeard the far famed pirate of the roanoke upon hearing these dread words sweet ellen armstrong was obliged to lean tremblingly for support upon the arm of arthur huntington whilst the stout hearted earl again addressed the stranger as follows if you are indeed the person whom you have represented yourself to be learn that i have often heard of your murderous exploits before and i now call upon you in the name of england s king to surrender yourself immediately to me as my prisoner after giving utterance to a loud derisive laugh whose echo as it reverberated amongst the rocky cliffs sounded like the fitful mirth of numerous invisible demons the pirate thus answered the bold summons of the earl you talk boldly for one whose brains i might instantly scatter to the four winds of heaven know you not that you and your companions are in my power i know replied the earl that i and my companions by making an easy signal can soon be supported by an hundred stout hearts from yonder ship whose ha sayst thou so interrupted the stranger i think that they will soon have other business upon their hands look yonder chapter ii description of characters sweet ellen armstrong sudden appearance of the piratical brig the earl s request blackbeard s decision the desperadoes the decision is enforced perilous situation of mary hamilton and ellen in order to carry forward the plan of our story in a consistent and intelligible manner it becomes necessary for us here to briefly explain some important particulars relating to the history of the earl of derwentwater and his companions previous to their landing upon the remote island of trinidad as related in the course of our first chapter the intelligent reader of history will undoubtedly recollect that the year two years before the time chosen for the commencement of our romance was rendered famous by the important insurrection which then took place throughout england and scotland in favor of the chevalier de st george or james the third a proud and haughty scion of the roman catholic house of stuart this singular and renowned rebellion although premature in its beginning and short in its duration caused during its continuence the hanoverian incumbent of the english sceptre to tremble for the permanence of his seat on the throne and though he at first pretended to despise both it and its authors he was finally compelled to use vigorous and extraordinary means to bring it to a summary and fatal conclusion through the instrumentality of foreign troops and the numerous cabels which sprang up in the rebel camp king george was soon enabled to quell this jacobitical insurrection which otherwise might have proved formidable enough to have overturned the protestant dynasty of the british realm and established in its place the despotic hierarchy of the church of rome so well aware was the reigning monarch and his ministers of the truth of the above important fact that they deemed it imperatively incumbent upon them in order to deal a death blow to all future attempts of the same nature to punish all the noblemen and other leading characters connected with it in the most severe and exemplary manner acting upon the above principle the privy council caused immediately to be arrested about thirty of the scotch and english nobility the majority of whom fell by the bloody axe of the executioner whilst the remainder were sentenced to perpetual banishment amongst this latter class of insurgents was george armstrong earl of derwentwater who succeeded to his father s rank and title immediately after his decease which happened somewhere about the year some time previous to his death however the old earl through his influence with the crown had obtained the grant of a large tract of land in the province of south carolina near the mouth of the roanoke river which was soon after settled by these minor and remote branches of his own extensive family whose fortunes had become sadly dilapidated by the frequent intestine revolutions which happened in great britain during the latter part of the seventeenth century upon the accession of queen anne to the english throne the old earl fell into disgrace with the ministry and with his family retired soon after that event to his plantations in america shortly after his arrival however the change of climate proved fatal to his advanced age and brought on an intermittent fever which ended his life and caused his only son george armstrong to succeed to his grand title and extensive estates although the character of the young earl differed in many important respects from that of his father still in one great feature there was an exact resemblance between them the disposition of the old earl was stubborn artful and avaricious whilst that of his son was frank open and generous in temper the former was cunning revengeful and unforgiving whilst that of the latter though hasty and violent in its outbreaks would a moment afterwards pass away leaving no lingering trace of its harsh and cruel effect upon the young earl s strong and vigorous mind here the wide contrast between the characters of the father and son ended for the same vaulting ambition which had animated the father through a long and eventful life descended upon the son in its full and unstinted measure whilst in blind and extravagant adherence to the house of stuart and the roman catholic religion the son greatly outstripped the father who had been moderate enough in
emerged from the house followed by the family who now gathered round the carriage to witness the departure of those who seemed to have succeeded in two brief hours in awakening an interest which is usually created only by a long and intimate acquaintance now mr amsden said the stranger turning to his host after placing his daughter in her seat now i will settle with you for the shoeing of the horse our dinners and all other trouble to say nothing of the hospitable kindness with which you all have made us feel so much at home what sir will be your bill ben what did mr dighton say he should charge asked the other turning to his boy forty cents sir was the prompt reply well forty cents then is the bill resumed the farmer yes but the rest of your charges we will trust you for that i should prefer to pay sir you may if you will allow me to direct the manner of payment very well sir speak on why when you get settled down in life again give some other traveller a dinner if he is as good company as you have been and that shall square the account between us i will however make your boys a present better see whether they will take any thing first sir o no no sir quickly interposed locke as the gentlemen was opening his purse not a cent for me mister that aint the way i get my living chimed in the spirited and proud little ben ah i see you are all determined to have your way at this time smilingly remarked the stranger however all may come right hereafter perhaps but as the matter now stands i have only to express my sense of obligation to each and all of you and one thing more before we part mr amsden let me repeat to you my advice to give this elder son of yours the chance for a good education do you think he has capacities which would warrant such a step sir asked the gratified mother of the boy indeed i certainly do madam even to sending him to a college replied the other that would be impossible in my circumstances provided i thought as you do on the subject remarked mr amsden let him go to a good academy then rejoined the stranger well now i do nt exactly know about that replied the other he may go winters to our district schools as long as he pleases and i think for the present at least that he should and will be quite satisfied with that is it not so locke why answered the boy diffidently i should be satisfied to go to our district masters if they could tell me the reasons of things which i always wish to know that is right master locke responded the stranger you have expressed in almost a word the great aim and essence of all true knowledge and philosophy to know the reason of things yes my young friend let that still be your ambition and if your father will give you the opportunity i doubt not you will do honor to the motto you have chosen well i would be a scholar locke if i was you added mary with charming navet and if you will and come and keep school where i live i will go to school to you and become a great scholar too if i can the travellers now took their leave of the family and drove from the yard attended by the repeatedly expressed good wishes of the good hearted farmer and his equally kind and more high minded companion and in these wishes they were joined by another who though he had uttered less yet felt more than they had expressed that was our young hero who as the rest of the family returned into the house stood mutely gazing after the receding carriage till its last traces were lost to his sight when he slowly turned away the big drops of tears standing in his eyes and his lip quivering with emotions which had been awakened by this brief but to him as will appear in the sequel important visit of these interesting strangers chapter ii the dream the thirst the wild desire delirious yet divine to know bulwer the accidental call of the travellers at the house of the farmer as narrated in our opening chapter formed an era in the life of locke amsden by that call new thoughts had been suggested to his mind new feelings and hopes awakened in his bosom and as the slumbering energies of his intellectual and moral nature became thus aroused young ambition began to point him upward to the temple of science over whose distanced hallowed pinnacles floated the mystic banner of fame at first every word of the revered stranger was recalled every position revolved over and over in mind and every argument carefully weighed and the result of the process was faith and conviction then came the inspiriting words of the beautiful little being who in angel shape had thus appeared in his path to incite him onward and i would be a scholar locke continued to ring in his ears ay and i will be a scholar he at length mentally ejaculated and then i will go where she lives and she shall know that i have worthily done her bidding and justified the good opinion of her father but where does she live yes where for he now recollected that he had not learned from her or her father the place of their residence and under the proud and joyous impulse which his reverie had imparted he flew to his parents with the inquiry but neither of them could answer it they had not ascertained even the family name of their visiters mr amsden had thought of asking the man these particulars but
had entirely obscured the light of the moon as a caleche and four with an extra postilion dashed off from the borg ognisanti on the mountain road towards bologna the inmates of the vehicle exchanged not a word the female seemed to be affrighted at the headlong speed with which the double team drew the light caleche up the mountain s side while a postilion sat so near and the attendant at the lady s side together seemed an excuse for the silence even if they were that which any one would have pronounced them a runaway couple anon the gentleman would offer some polite attention to his companion but without the exchange of a syllable and indeed words could hardly have been heard at the rate they were driving through the dark on account of the loud noise of the wheels and horses feet among the stones and uneven soil of the rising ground on rolled the vehicle with the speed of the wind every one knows how florentine horses can go when they have a mind to until at length it pulled up at a highland roadside inn of most uninviting character the lady was immediately assisted in silence from the vehicle and scarcely had they entered the low dark parlor of the inn before the gentleman whispered to her the priest is here and will unite us immediately but why this haste dear carlton said florinda for it was her there is no time to lose was the whispered response but should not hush florinda but carlton he is here was the whispered interruption and in a moment more a priest made his appearance and without giving either time to unrobe themselves had they been so inclined commenced the marriage service the ring was given in that dark room so dark that the features even of the minister of the church could not be discerned the prayer was made and the two were solemnly declared to be husband and wife the lady had essayed several times to speak aloud as we have seen to express some feeling or wish and she seemed as if anticipating some encouragement from him she was about to wed but she was each time hushed by the speed with which everything was done or by a gentle whisper from her companion the ceremony completed the signora drew back to a chair overcome by her swift ride and the emotions that crowded themselves upon her throbbing and trembling heart at this moment there entered the apartment the tall figure of a man apparently advanced is years who turning his back upon florinda conversed for a moment with the bridegroom then both turning towards florinda at the moment a couple of lamps were introduced into the room when lo she beheld before her signor latrezzi her uncle and her husband petro giampetti with a scream of horror and affright she fell fainting upon the floor the uncle and nephew were both filled with horror for both believed that they had killed her as they gazed upon her pale and lifeless form either would lave sacrificed everything to have taken all back again and restored her to life and happiness can this be thee petro giampetti trembling like a child nay a tear actually wetting that swarthy check as you chafe the pulse and bathe the temples of that insensible girl and hast thou really so tender a heart and yet couldst enter into so hard hearted a conspiracy and thou signor latrezzi well mayst thou hide thy face in thy hands for thou art the greatest sinner here thine has been the hand that hath done this that hath triumphed over this poor girl whom thou shouldst have protected holy virgin cried petro she s dead say not so eagerly exclaimed her uncle god forgive us answered petro ay we have need of forgiveness if we have brought on such extremity said the uncle trying to raise the lifeless head of their inanimate victim leaving the guilty nephew and uncle for a while we will take the reader back for a moment in the thread of our story chapter xi the intercepted letter any man that can write may answer a letter romeo and juliet in such a tale as we now tell you gentle reader and when written within such limits it is impossible to keep each portion of the plot equally advanced or rather not to anticipate certain results there is also an advantage in this mode of arrangement which perhaps is in itself sufficient excuse for the author it heightens the plot and renders it more absorbing to the reader by suddenly laying before him some startling tableau and seeming inconsistency but which the sequel of the story renders plain and reconcilable with other portions of the story having said thus much for the scene we have presented to the reader at the roadside inn on the apennines we must now go back with him to the night on which carlton delivered his letter of arrangement to florinda and thus render our tale plain to the comprehension of all carlton as we have said perfected his plan for the proposed elopement and in another letter to florinda he communicated the particulars delivering the missive with his own hands as heretofore there was a certain hour agreed upon between them in which signora florinda was to be at the balcony of her apartment every evening and thus although carlton might not be able to hold much conversation with her yet he could deliver any written paper he might desire without the fear of interruption or detection it was necessary to accomplish all with the utmost secrecy in order to ensure success now petro had been led to suspect by some circumstances that the meetings between carlton and his cousin had been renewed he determined to ascertain if this was the case through his own personal observation and on the occasion of the
the cup of joy was raised to my eager lips and i was about to quaff its bewildering contents to be balked by the unexpected entrance of that accused chevalier confusion i shall go mad with vexation well tis of no use to grumble about what ca nt be helped let me rather turn my attention to future joys concerning which there can be no disappointment my plans are all arranged in a few days my pretty fanny aubrey will be an inmate of the luxurious chambers of love ha ha that thought almost reconciles me to the loss of the duchess though egad she is a luscious piece all fire all sentiment all enthusiasm but oh five thousand dollars five thousand dollars but let me see where is the infernal trap of that scoundrel jew mike whom sow nance recommended as a fellow well qualified to abduct my pretty fanny and convey her to the chambers ah good his address is in my memorandum book inquire for the pig pen no ann street any night after midnight ugh i do nt like this venturing among cut throats and thieves at such untimely hours but nothing risk nothing have and anything for love the reader s attention is now summoned to the scene which transpired between the chevalier and the duchess immediately after the departure of mr tickels from the house the duchess who had been sitting upon the sofa bathed in tears and sobbing as if her heart would break jumped up bounded across the carpet in a series of graceful pirouettes and then throwing herself upon the floor indulged in a peal of silvery laughter that made the room fairly echo exclaiming what a d d old fool that man is oh i shall die i shall positively suffocate with mirth the chevalier throwing aside every appearance of indignation and dignity placed himself in that humorous and rather vulgar position sometimes adopted by jocose youths who wish to intimate to their friends the fact that any individual has been most egregiously sucked in fearing that the uninitiated may not readily comprehend this pantomimic witticism we may as well state for their enlightenment that it is accomplished by applying the thumb to the tip of the nose and executing a series of gyrations with the open hand the whole affair being a very playful and ingenious invention much practised by newsboys cabmen second hand clothes dealers and sporting gentlemen a cool five thousand shouted the chevalier abandoning this comic picture and squaring off at his reflection in the mirror in the most approved style of the pugilistic art as if he were about to give himself a punch in the head for being such a funny clever dog bravo i ll go and get the cheque cashed at once and then hurrah for a brilliant season of glorious dissipation but my duchess how the devil did you mange to get the old fool so infatuated so crazy with passion for i stood over ten minutes looking at both of you through the key hole before i entered the room and i never before saw a man act so extravagantly ludicrous it was only with extreme difficulty that i could keep myself from laughing outright and you witch that you are looked as if you were panting and dying with amorous desires by my soul twas admirably done the duchess smiled with gratification at the praise and arising from the carpet on which she had been literally rolling in the excess of her mirth threw herself upon the sofa in an attitude of voluptuous abandonment and while complacently viewing her matchless leg she said for your especial entertainment my chevalier i will relate all that transpired between me and the old goat after your departure at first he assailed me with a profusion of silly sickening compliments on my beauty i blushed you know how well i can blush when i try and assured him that his praises were divine so eloquent so elegantly conveyed and yet i thought them intolerably stupid then i gave him my hand to kiss and its contact with his lips made him as amorous as i could possibly desire he knelt at my feet then arose apologizing for his rudeness i threw all my powers of fascination into my looks and permitted him to take a seat by my side on the sofa at first he sat apart from me but at last gaining courage he moved close to me and gently placed his arm around my waist of course i did not repulse him with secret joy i observed the eagerness with which he regarded such parts of my person as were exposed and i took good care to reveal it liberally how the odious old wretch gloated upon this bust which you my chevalier pronounce so charming at last he kissed me ugh how horribly the old creature s breath smelt but i pretended to be more pleased than angry and from my lips his nauseous mouth wandered to my neck my shoulders my bosom i fairly shuddered as he besmeared me with his disgusting kisses and thinking that he had gone far enough for that time i burst from his embrace and reproached him but not too severely for his rude behavior taking good care however to fan his passions into a still fiercer flame by telling him that my reason for particularly dreading such familiarities was that they had a tendency to excite my own desires to a degree that was dangerous to my honor as i foresaw this artful assurance was received by him with ill concealed delight he begged my pardon it is needless to say i forgave him and suffered him to resume his seat at my side on condition that he would take no further liberties knowing very well that he could not long keep his promise then came more compliments i sang and played for
and hailing the pequod to give notice of his intentions at once proceeded to reap the fruit of his unrighteous cunning seizing his sharp boat spade he commenced an excavation in the body a little behind the side fin you would almost have thought he was digging a cellar there in the sea and when at length his spade struck against the gaunt ribs it was like turning up old roman tiles and pottery buried in fat english loam his boat s crew were all in high excitement eagerly helping their chief and looking as anxious as gold hunters and all the time numberless fowls were diving and ducking and screaming and yelling and fighting around them stubb was beginning to look disappointed especially as the horrible nosegay increased when suddenly from out the very heart of this plague there stole a faint stream of perfume which flowed through the tide of bad smells without being absorbed by it as one river will flow into and then along with another without at all blending with it for a time i have it i have it cried stubb with delight striking something in the subterranean regions a purse a purse dropping his spade he thrust both hands in and drew out handfuls of something that looked like ripe windsor soap or rich mottled old cheese very unctuous and savory withal you might easily dent it with your thumb it is of a hue between yellow and ash colour and this good friends is ambergris worth a gold guinea an ounce to any druggist some six handfuls were obtained but more was unavoidably lost in the sea and still more perhaps might have been secured were it not for impatient ahab s loud command to stubb to desist and come on board else the ship would bid them good bye chapter ambergris now this ambergris is a very curious substance and so important as an article of commerce that in a certain nantucket born captain coffin was examined at the bar of the english house of commons on that subject for at that time and indeed until a comparatively late day the precise origin of ambergris remained like amber itself a problem to the learned though the word ambergris is but the french compound for grey amber yet the two substances are quite distinct for amber though at times found on the sea coast is also dug up in some far inland soils whereas ambergris is never found except upon the sea besides amber is a hard transparent brittle odorless substance used for mouth pieces to pipes for beads and ornaments but ambergris is soft waxy and so highly fragrant and spicy that it is largely used in perfumery in pastiles precious candles hair powders and pomatum the turks use it in cooking and also carry it to mecca for the same purpose that frankincense is carried to st peter s in rome some wine merchants drop a few grains into claret to flavor it who would think then that such fine ladies and gentlemen should regale themselves with an essence found in the inglorious bowels of a sick whale yet so it is by some ambergris is supposed to be the cause and by others the effect of the dyspepsia in the whale how to cure such a dyspepsia it were hard to say unless by administering three or four boat loads of brandreth s pills and then running out of harm s way as laborers do in blasting rocks i have forgotten to say that there were found in this ambergris certain hard round bony plates which at first stubb thought might be sailors trowsers buttons but it afterwards turned out that they were nothing more than pieces of small squid bones embalmed in that manner now that the incorruption of this most fragrant ambergris should be found in the heart of such decay is this nothing bethink thee of that saying of st paul in corinthians about corruption and incorruption how that we are sown in dishonour but raised in glory and likewise call to mind that saying of paracelsus about what it is that maketh the best musk also forget not the strange fact that of all things of ill savor cologne water in its rudimental manufacturing stages is the worst i should like to conclude the chapter with the above appeal but cannot owing to my anxiety to repel a charge often made against whalemen and which in the estimation of some already biased minds might be considered as indirectly substantiated by what has been said of the frenchman s two whales elsewhere in this volume the slanderous aspersion has been disproved that the vocation of whaling is throughout a slatternly untidy business but there is another thing to rebut they hint that all whales always smell bad now how did this odious stigma originate i opine that it is plainly traceable to the first arrival of the greenland whaling ships in london more than two centuries ago because those whalemen did not then and do not now try out their oil at sea as the southern ships have always done but cutting up the fresh blubber in small bits thrust it through the bung holes of large casks and carry it home in that manner the shortness of the season in those icy seas and the sudden and violent storms to which they are exposed forbidding any other course the consequence is that upon breaking into the hold and unloading one of these whale cemeteries in the greenland dock a savor is given forth somewhat similar to that arising from excavating an old city grave yard for the foundations of a lying in hospital i partly surmise also that this wicked charge against whalers may be likewise imputed to the existence on the coast of greenland in former times of a dutch village called schmerenburgh or smeerenberg which latter name is the one used by the
wise humanity they submitted to a condition in which providence had placed them they settled the question in the deep foundations of the constitution would you then sir destroy the fabric by undermining the constitution alas this would be the consequence were it possible to carry out the views of the abolition party the beautiful words of harrison g otis delivered in faneuil hall boston aug d would have been appropriate here too speaking of the formation of anti slavery societies he said suppose an article had been proposed to the congress that framed the instrument of confederation proposing that the northern states should be at liberty to form anti slavery associations and deluge the south with homilies upon slavery how would it have been received the gentleman before me apostrophized the image of washington i will follow his example and point to the portrait of his associate hancock which is pendant by its side let us imagine an interview between them in the company of friends just after one had signed the commission for the other and in ruminating on the lights and shadows of futurity hancock should have said i congratulate my country upon the choice she has made and i foresee that the laurels you gained in the field of braddock s defeat will be twined with those which shall be earned by you in the war of independence yet such are the prejudices in my part of the union against slavery that although your name and services may screen you from opprobrium during your life your countrymen when millions weep over your tomb will be branded by mine as man stealers and murderers and the stain of it consequently annexed to your memory but alas the abolitionist will not reflect he lives in a whirlpool whither he has been drawn by his own rashness what to him is the love of country or the memory of washington john randolph said i should have been a french atheist had not my mother made me kneel beside her as she folded my little hands and taught me to say our father remember this mothers in america and imprint upon the fair tablet of your young child s heart a reverence for the early institutions of their country and for the patriots who moulded them that god and my country may be the motto of their lives chapter xxii alice said mrs weston as they sat together one morning before it was time to dress for dinner if you choose i will read to you the last part of cousin janet s letter you know my daughter of walter s gay course in richmond and it is as i always feared there is a tendency to recklessness and dissipation in walter s disposition with what a spirit of deep thankfulness you should review the last few months of your life i have sometimes feared i was unjust to walter my regret at the attachment for him which you felt at one time became a personal dislike which i acknowledge i was wrong to yield to but i think we both acted naturally circumstanced as we were dear as you are to me i would rather see you dead than the victim of an unhappy marriage love is not blind as many say i believe the stronger one s love is the more palpable the errors of its object it was so with me and it would be so with you that you have conquered this attachment is the crowning blessing of my life even should you choose never to consummate your engagement with arthur i will at least thank god that you are not the wife of a man whose violent passions even as a child could not be controlled and who is destitute of a spark of religious principle i will now read you what cousin janet says i have received a long letter from mr c the episcopal clergyman in richmond in answer to mine inquiring of walter all that i feared is true walter is not only gay but dissipated mr c says he has called to see him repeatedly and invited him to his house and has done all that he could to interest him in those pleasures that are innocent and ennobling but alas it is difficult to lay aside the wine cup when its intoxicating touch is familiar to the lips and so of the other forbidden pleasures of life to one of walter s temperament there is two fold danger walter is gambling too and bets high he will of course be a prey to the more experienced ones who will take advantage of his youth and generosity to rob him for is a professed gambler better than a common thief it is needless for me to say i have shed many tears over this letter tears are for the living and i expect to shed them while i wear this garment of mortality can it be that in this case the wise creator will visit the sins of the father upon the child are are all my tears and prayers to fail i cannot think so while he reigns in heaven in the same body with which he suffered on earth in the very hand that holds the sceptre is the print of the nails under the royal crown that encircles his brow can still be traced the marks of the thorns he is surely then touched with a feeling of our infirmities and he will in the end bring home this child of my love and my adoption i often say to myself could i see alice and arthur and walter happy how happy should i be i would be more than willing to depart but there would be still a care for something in this worn out and withered frame it will be far better to be with jesus but he will keep me here as long as he
apron the shining curls she looked on with a malicious smile while they crisped and blackened in the glowing lehigh fire but miserable as were the week days sunday after all was the dreadful day for katy the long long long sunday when every book in the house was put un der lock and key when even religious newspapers tracts and memoirs were tabooed when the old people who fancied they could not go to church sat from sunrise to sunset in their best clothes with their hands folded looking speechlessly into the fire when there was no dinner when the irish girl and the cat equally lawless and heretical went to see their friends when not a sound was heard in the house save the ticking of the old claw footed clock that stood in the entry when katy crept up to her room and crouching in a corner wondered if god was good why he let her papa die and why he did not help her mamma who tried so hard to earn money to bring her home the last bright golden beam of the sabbath sun had slowly faded away one by one the stars came gliding out he who held them all in their places listening ever to the ceaseless music of their motion yet bent a pitying ear to the stifled sob of a troubled child softly sweetly fell the gentle dew of slumber on weary eyelids while angels came to minister tears glittered still on katy s long lashes but the little lips parted with a smile murmuring papa sleep on dream on little katy he who noteth the sparrow s fall hath given his angels charge to keep thee chapter lxvii in one of the thousand business offices in one of the thousand crowded streets of a neighboring city sat mr john walter with his legs crossed his right finger pressed against the right lobe of his organ of causality his right elbow resting on his right knee and the fingers of his left hand beating a sort of tattoo on a fresh copy of the standard which lay upon the table by his side his attitude was one of profound meditation who can she be exclaimed mr walter in a tone of blended interest and vexation who can she be mr walter raised his head uncrossed his legs took up the standard and re read floy s last article slowly often pausing to analyze the sentences as though he would extort from them some hidden meaning to serve as a clue to the identity of the author after he had perused the article thus searchingly he laid down the standard and again exclaimed who can she be she is a genius certainly whoever she is continued he soliloquizingly a bitter life experience she has had too she did not draw upon her imagination for this article like the very first production of her pen that i read it is a wail from her inmost soul so are many of her pieces a few dozen of them taken consecutively would form a whole history of wrong and suffering and bitter sorrow what a singular being she must be if i have formed a correct opinion of her what powers of endurance what an elastic strong brave loving fiery yet soft and winning nature a bundle of contradictions and how famously she has got on too it is only a little more than a year since her first piece was published and now her articles flood the whole country i seldom take up an exchange which does not contain one or more of them that first piece of hers was a stroke of genius a real gem although not very smoothly polished ever since i read it i have been trying to find out the author s name and have watched her career with eager interest her career i say for i suppose floy to be a woman notwithstanding the rumors to the contrary at any rate my wife says so and women have an instinct about such things i wish i knew whether she gets well paid for her writings probably not inexperienced writers seldom get more than a mere pittance there are so many ready to write poor fools for the honor and glory of the thing and there are so many ready to take advantage of this fact and withhold from needy talent the moral right to a deserved remuneration thank heaven i have never practiced this the household messenger does not yield me a very large income but what it does yield is fairly earned why bless me exclaimed mr walter suddenly starting up and as suddenly sitting down again why has not this idea occurred to me before yes why not engage floy to write for the household messenger how i wish i were rich that i might give her such a price as she really deserves let me see she now writes for the standard and the pilgrim four pieces a week for each eight pieces in all that is too much work for her to begin with she cannot do herself justice she ought not to write at the outside more than two pieces a week then she could polish them up and strengthen them and render them as nearly perfect in execution as they are in conception one piece a week would be as much as i should wish could i possibly afford to pay her as much or more for that one piece as she now gets for eight her name is a tower of strength but its influence would be frittered away were she to write for more than one paper if i could secure her pen all to myself the advertising that such a connection would give the messenger would be worth something ah me were my purse only commensurate with my feelings if i only knew who floy is and could have
him how plausible were the excuses that arose in her mind and now where had they fled the very power of speech seemed abandoning her she almost longed for some taunting word another cold sneer at least they would have stung her into eloquence but that dull quiet silence chained up her faculties she sat gazing on the floor mute and pale and he remained in his seat coldly regarding her at length the stillness grew irksome to him i am waiting patiently ada waiting to hear why you abandoned your husband she started her eye kindled and the fiery blood flashed into her cheek i did not abandon my husband he left me for a journey but for a journey was the calm reply yes such journeys as you had taken before and with a like motive leaving me young penniless beset with temptation tortured with jealousy on that very journey you had a companion she looked at him as if eager even then against her own positive knowledge to hear a denial of her accusations but he only smiled and murmured softly yes yes i remember it was a pleasant journey it drove me wild i was not myself suspicions such suspicions haunted me i thought i believed nay believe now that you wished me to go that you longed to get rid of me nay that you encouraged i cannot frame words for the thought even now he had lent you money large sums william william in the name of heaven tell me that it was not for this i was left alone in debt and helpless say that you did not yourself thrust me into that terrible temptation she laid her hand upon his arm and grasped it hard her eyes searched his to the soul he smiled her hand dropped her countenance fell and oh such bitter disappointment broke through her voice it has been the vulture preying on my heart ever since a word would have torn it away but you will not take the trouble even to deceive me you smile only smile i only smile at the absurdity of your suspicion she looked up eagerly but with doubt in her face she panted to believe him but lacked the necessary faith i asked him to deny this on his death bed and he could not then he is dead was the quick rejoinder he is dead yes he is dead she answered in a low voice and the daughter his heiress she too is dead he longed to ask another question his eyes absolutely gleamed with eagerness but his self control was wonderful a direct question might expose the unutterable meanness of his hope he must obtain what he panted to know by circuitous means and you staid by him to the last she turned upon him a sharp and penetrating look he felt the whole force of her glance and assumed an expression well calculated to deceive a much less excitable observer i thought he said that you had been living in retirement that you left the noble villain without public disgrace it was a great satisfaction for me to know this i did leave him i did live in retirement toiled for my own bread by wrestling with poverty i strove to win back some portion of content yet you were with him when he died it was a mournful death bed he sent for me and i went oh it was a mournful death bed tears rolled down her cheeks she covered her face with both hands i had been the governess of his daughter her nurse in the last sickness and you lived apart alone you and this daughter she died in florence we were alone she was sent home for burial and to be a governess to this young lady you abandoned your own child only to be governess can you say to me ada that it was only to be a governess to this young lady there was feeling in his voice something of stern dignity perhaps at the moment he did feel she thought so and it gave her hope she had not removed her hands they still covered her face and a faint murmur only broke through the fingers oh what cowards sin makes of us that poor woman dared not tell the truth she shrunk from uttering a positive falsehood hence the humiliating murmur that stole from her pallid lips the sickening shudder that ran through her frame you do not answer said the husband for leicester was her husband you do not answer she had gathered courage enough to utter the falsehood and dropping her hands replied in a firm voice disagreeably firm for the lie cost her proud spirit a terrible effort and she could not utter it naturally as he would have done yes i can answer it was to be the young lady s governess that i went only to be her governess penniless abandoned what else could i do he did not believe her in his soul he knew that she was not speaking the truth but there was something yet to learn and in the end it might be policy to feign a belief which he could not feel so after wasting youth and talent on his daughter paling your beauty over her death bed and his this pitiful man could leave you to poverty and toil did he expect that i would receive you again after that suspicious desertion no no the wild thought was mine you once loved me william the tears were swelling in her eyes again few men could have resisted the look of those eyes the sweet pleading of her voice for the contrast with her usual imperious pride had something very touching in it you were very beautiful then he said very beautiful and am i so much changed she answered with a smile of gentle sweetness in his secret heart
sent this afternoon but about two hours ago he came to me and declared that he had changed his mind and would not part with them i offered double the original amount but he said money was no inducement i strove to borrow or hire for any given time but every proposal was peremptorily declined and as it is impossible to leave here i came over to entreat you to remain with my sister at least for a few days till we can determine what is advisable to do his proposal was accepted and the ensuing day saw them inmates of mrs carlton s chapter xix we re the sons of sires that baffled crowned and mitered tyranny they defied the field and scaffold for their birth rights so will we campbell the issue of the engagement of the th october placed goliad with valuable munitions in the hands of the texans many and joyous acclamations rose from their camp hope beamed on every face and sanguine expectations were entertained of a speedy termination of the conflict slowly the little band proceeded toward bexar receiving daily accessions from headquarters and girding themselves for a desperate struggle general cos fully appreciating the importance of the post he held made active preparation for its defense never doubting however that the strong fortifications of the alamo would prove impregnable to assailants so feeble numerically under the direction of the cautious spaniard the town already assumed a beleaguered aspect and in addition to the watchman stationed on the observatory of the fortress a sentinel paced to and fro on the flat roof of the gray old church having orders to give instant alarm in case of danger by the ringing of the several bells silver haired men bending beneath the weight of years alone passed along the deserted streets and augured of the future in the now silent plaza the stores were closed and anxiously the few americans awaited the result rising at dawn with the belief that ere twilight closed again their suspense would be terminated on the morning of the th the booming of distant artillery was borne on the southern breeze with throbbing hearts the inhabitants gathered about their doors and strained their eyes toward the south a large body of mexicans availing themselves of the cover of night sallied from the alamo hoping to cut off a squad of ninety two men who leaving the main body of the texan army had advanced for the purpose of reconnoitering and were posted at the old mission of conception some two miles below the town and here the contest was waged the watchman on the church listened intently as each report reached his ear and kept his fingers firmly on the bell rope an hour passed on and the sun rode high in heaven gradually the thundering died away quicker grew the breathing and tighter the cold fingers clasped each other the last sound ceased a deathlike silence reigned throughout the town and many a cheek grew colorless as marble there came a confused sound of shouts the mingling of many voices the distant tramp of cavalry and then there fell on the aching ears the deep thrilling tones of the church bells an intervening bend in the river was quickly passed and a body of mexican cavalry dashed at full gallop across the plain nor slackened their pace till secure behind the somber walls of the alamo at intervals of every few moments small squads pushed in then a running band of infantry and lastly a solitary horseman reeling in his saddle dripping with gore madly his wounded horse sprung on when just as the fort was gained his luckless rider rolled senseless at the entrance one deep groan was echoed from church to fortress victory which had hovered doubtful o er the bloody field settled at last on the banner of the lone star against what fearful odds is victory ofttimes won the intrepid texans assaulted by forces which trebled their own fought as only texans can with unerring precision they lifted their rifles and artillerymen and officers rolled together in the dust the brave little band conquered and the flying mexicans left them sole masters of the field of the horseshoe on the hill which rose just beyond the town stood in bold relief against the eastern sky a tall square building to which the sobriquet of powder house was applied here as a means of increased vigilance was placed a body of horse for the purpose of watching the plain which stretched along the river fearing every moment to see the victorious texans at the heels of their retreating infantry they had orders to dash in at the first glimpse of the advance guard of the enemy but night closed and none appeared and dreading the morning light many lay down to sleep at the close of that eventful day several hours elapsed and then the texan forces under general burleson wound across the valley and settled along the verge of the town the alamo was beleaguered forced as it were to remain a witness of the horrors of the then approaching conflict the cousins strove to cast from them the gloomy forebodings which crept into their hearts darkening the present and investing the future with phantoms of terror mrs carlton and mary were far more hopeful than the remainder of the little circle and kept up the semblance of cheerfulness which ever flies at the approach of danger the girls saw but little of the gentlemen for mr carlton was ever out in search of tidings from the camp and frank in opposition to his sister s tearful entreaties had enlisted immediately after general burleson s arrival his manner during his brief visits was considerate and kind yet mary fancied at times that he avoided her though marking her declining health he had prescribed some simple remedy and never failed to inquire if she were not improving
in taking it but thanks to that overruling power in whose hands we all are i have been most mysteriously preserved from setting the seal upon my own wretchedness i see you are incredulous but there is one here who feels that i speak the truth exonerated in her eyes i can bear the fate which in all probability awaits me he raised helen s hand to his lips fervently pressed it replaced it on her lap and folding his arms he signified his readiness to accompany them wherever they wished the sympathies of mr forrester s family were with him for they knew all he had borne and they believed his solemn assertion of his innocence of the crime but it was not thus with the remainder of the company they regarded the scene they had just witnessed as well got up for effect but their conviction of clinton s guilt remained unshaken his captors congratulated each other that court was then sitting in the county seat and the criminal could be summarily dealt with before the feeling of indignation at his audacious crime had time to subside accompanied by two of the most zealous clinton was placed in a carriage taken to f and before the dawn of day he was lodged in jail to await his trial for life or death as the murderer of charles hilton chapter xxiii flora wished to retain helen with her but this mrs wilmot positively refused angry and indignant at what had just passed she would not permit her niece to remain at braeburn exhausted by the variety of emotions she had contended with for so many hours the unhappy being was herself quite passive she submitted to be taken to the carriage and conveyed to bellevue where she was placed in bed and a physician summoned he administered a powerful narcotic and like an overtasked child helen at length fell into a deep and dreamless sleep when she awoke she was feverish and slightly delirious dr pronounced her in a nervous fever and insisted that she should be kept perfectly quiet flora and bessie shared with her aunt and mother the cares of her sick room and many were the tears shed by her two friends over this young martyr to worldly aggrandizement helen lay white and motionless for hours with no sign of intelligence or suffering save an occasional tear that welled from the half closed eyes betraying that amidst the aberration of intellect caused by the fever which burned in her veins she was still conscious of the mighty weight of misery that lay as a burden on her soul on the morning after the murder the body of hilton was brought to bellevue for interment attended by a large concourse of persons his remains were conveyed to their last resting place and now all that remained to consummate the tragedy was to bring speedy punishment to the perpetrator of the deed though hilton had not been a popular man the circumstances of his death awoke a wide spread feeling of indignation and speedy retribution to the author of his fate was the universal wish clinton was a stranger and there was no one to raise a voice in his behalf save mr forrester and his new son the latter too little known in the neighborhood himself to have much influence the minds of all men in the community were decided as to the question of the prisoner s guilt and since he must die why prolong the tortures of suspense let him be condemned at once and the demands of justice satisfied through the powerful influence of hilton s connections the trial was hurried on for there was no one to insist that in the excited state of public feeling it would be impossible to obtain an unprejudiced jury clinton s guilt appeared to be so clear and palpable that this was scarcely deemed of great importance he was tried within a few days after the murder he adhered to the statement he had already made but in the face of the evidence against him it was received with universal disbelief sentence was pronounced against him death and but one week given to prepare for the awful change the prisoner heard his doom with calmness and returned to his cell to write to his friends and inform them of the terrible fate which hung over him this accomplished he took up his pen to address helen but his courage failed him what could he say to console the stricken one she believed him innocent for he knew that his solemn assurance in that last heart rending interview had carried conviction to her at least the time must arrive when his name would be vindicated from this imputation but too late to save him from its penalty and she would probably perish a victim to her sorrowful fate before that hour rolled around he did not ask for prolonged life for her could he have clasped her in his arms and thus have gone to meet the award of the deeds done on earth he would have welcomed death but to leave helen to the loneliness of her anguish was a terrible thought he heard of her illness with joy and really hoped that before the knowledge of his unhappy doom could reach her she would be forever at rest the news of clinton s condemnation soon reached bellevue helen still lay apparently in the same dreamy half unconscious state though her physical powers did not seem to waste away beneath the sufferings of her mind after the third day of her illness she did not refuse food when it was offered for she wished to regain her usual strength as the mind struggled back to consciousness a restless feeling awoke within it that on her depended the preservation of her lover to her would be given the power to atone to him for all the anguish she
had an undue regard for lena why should he wish to see her the wife of another and that other his son was it his better and nobler nature struggling to save her from evil which prompted the wish durward hoped so he believed so and the confidence which had so recently been shaken was fully restored when by the light of the hall lamp at home he saw how white and almost ghostly was the face which ere they entered the drawing room turned imploringly upon him asking him to be careful mrs graham had been in a fit of the sulks ever since the morning of mrs livingstone s call and now though she had not seen her husband for several days she merely held out her hand turning her head meantime and replying to his questions in a low quiet kind of a much injured woman way as provoking as it was uncalled for father s suggestion was a good one thought durward when he had retired to rest lena is too beautiful to be alone in the world i will propose to her at once and she will thus be out of danger but what should he do with her should he bring her there to woodlawn where scarcely a day passed without some domestic storm no his home should be full of sunlight of music and flowers where no angry word or darkening frown could ever find entrance and thus dreaming of a blissful future when lena should be his bride he fell asleep chapter xxi joel slocum in this chapter it may not be out of place to introduce an individual who though not a very important personage is still in some degree connected with our story on the night when durward and his father were riding home from frankfort the family at maple grove with the exception of grandma were as usual assembled in the parlor john jr had returned and purposely telling his mother and carrie whom he had left with lena had succeeded in putting them both into an uncomfortable humor the latter secretly lamenting the mistake which she had committed in suffering lena to stay with mabel but it could not be remedied now there was no good reason for calling her home and the lady broke at least three cambric needles in her vigorous jerks at the handkerchief she was hemming a heavy tread upon the piazza a loud ring of the bell and carrie straightened up thinking it might possibly be durward who had called on his way home but the voice was strange and rather impatiently she waited does mr john livingstone live here asked the stranger of the negro who answered the summons yes sir answered the servant eyeing the new comer askance and is old miss nichols and helleny to hum the negro grinned answering in the affirmative and asking the young man to walk in wall guess i will said he advancing a few steps toward the parlor door then suddenly halting he added more to himself than to the negro darned if i do nt go the hull figger and send in my card as they do to boston so saying he drew from his pocket an embossed card and bending his knee for a table he wrote with sundry nourishes mr joel slocum esq slocumville massachusetts there hand that to your boss said he and tell him i m out in the entry at the same time he stepped before the hat stand rubbing up his oily hair and thinking mr joel slocum would make an impression anywhere who is it ben whispered carrie dunno miss said the negro passing the card to his master and waiting in silence for his orders mr joel slocum esq slocumville massachusetts slowly read mr livingstone wondering where he had heard that name before who simultaneously asked carrie and anna while their mother looked wonderingly up instantly john jr remembered lena s love letter and anticipating fun exclaimed show him in ben show him in while ben is showing him in we will introduce him more fully to our readers promising that the picture is not overdrawn but such as we saw it in our native state joel belonged to that extreme class of yankees with which we sometimes though not often meet brought up among the new england mountains he was almost wholly ignorant of what really belonged to good manners fancying that he knew everything and sneering at those of his acquaintance who being of a more quiet turn of mind were content to settle down in the home of their fathers caring little or nothing for the world without but as for him he was bound he said to see the elephant and if his brothers were green enough to stay tied to their mother s apron strings they might do it but he would nt no sir he was going to make something of himself to effect this about two years before the time of which we are speaking he went to boston to learn the art of daguerreotype taking in which he really did seem to excel returning home with some money a great deal of vanity and a strong propensity to boast of what he had seen recollections of lena his early and as he sentimentally expressed it his undying all enduring love still haunted him and at last he determined upon a tour to kentucky purchasing for the occasion a rather fantastic suit consisting of greenish pants blue coat red vest and yellow neck handkerchief these he laid carefully by in his trunk until he reached lexington where he intended stopping for a time hanging out a naming sign which announced his presence and capabilities after spending a few days in the city endeavoring to impress its inhabitants with a sense of his consequence and mentally styling them all know nothings be cause they did not seem to be
a state of the most perfect composure the singular terror of her father and the boldness and assurance of the intruder were to miss stevens something inexplicable she stood looking from one to the other as though seeking an explanation and on observing symptoms of a return to consciousness on the part of her parent she turned to mccloskey and said appealingly you see how your presence has agitated my father pray let me conjure you go be your errand what it may i promise you it shall have the earliest attention or said she tell me what it is perhaps i can see to it i attend a great deal to father s business pray tell me no no exclaimed the old man who had caught the last few words of his daughter no no not a syllable here i m well i m well enough i ll attend to you there there that will do he continued addressing the servant leave the room and you he added turning to his daughter do you go too i am much better now and can talk to him go go he cried impatiently as he saw evidences of a disposition to linger on her part if i want you i ll ring go this person wo nt stay long not if i get what i came for miss said mccloskey insolently otherwise there is no knowing how long i may stay with a look of apprehension lizzie quitted the room and the murderer and his accomplice were alone together mr stevens reached across the table drew the liquor towards him and recklessly pouring out a large quantity drained the glass to the bottom this seemed to nerve him up and give him courage for he turned to mccloskey and said with a much bolder air than he had yet shown in addressing him so you re back again villain are you i thought and hoped you were dead and he leaned back in his chair and closed his eyes as if to shut out some horrid spectre i ve been divilish near it squire but providence has preserved me ye see jist to be a comfort to ye in yer old age i ve been shipwrecked blown up in steamboats and i ve had favers and choleray and the divil alone knows what but i ve been marcifully presarved to ye and hope ye ll see a good dale of me this many years to come mr stevens glared at him fiercely for a few seconds and then rejoined you promised me solemnly five years ago that you would never trouble me again and i gave you money enough to have kept you in comfort ay luxury for the remainder of your life where is it all now that s more than i can tell you squire i only know how it comes i do nt trouble myself how it goes that s your look out if ye are anxious on that score you d better hire a bookkeeper for me he shall send yer honour a quarterly account and then it wo nt come on ye so sudden when it s all out another time insolent muttered mr stevens mccloskey gave mr stevens an impudent look but beyond that took no farther notice of his remark but proceeded with the utmost coolness to pour out another glass of brandy after which he drew his chair closer to the grate and placed his dirty feet upon the mantelpiece in close proximity to an alabaster clock you make yourself very much at home said stevens indignantly why should nt i answered his tormentor in a tone of the most perfect good humour why should nt i in the house of an ould acquaintance and particular friend just the place to feel at home eh stevens then folding his arms and tilting back his chair he asked coolly you have nt a cigar have ye no replied stevens surlily and if i had you should not have it your insolence is unbearable you appear continued he with some show of dignity to have forgotten who i am and who you are ye re mistaken there squire divil a bit have i i m mccloskey and you are slippery george an animal that s known over the varsal world as a philadelphia lawyer a man that s chated his hundreds and if he lives long enough he ll chate as many more savin his friend mr mccloskey and him he ll not be afther chating because he wo nt be able to get a chance although he d like to if he could divil a doubt of that it s false i never tried to cheat you rejoined stevens courageously for the liquor was beginning to have a very inspiriting effect it s a lie i paid you all i agreed upon and more besides but you are like a leech never satisfied you have had from me altogether nearly twenty thousand dollars and you ll not get much more now mind i tell you the divil i wo nt rejoined he angrily that is yet to be seen how would you like to make yer appearance at court some fine morning on the charge of murther eh mr stevens gave a perceptible shudder and looked round whereupon mccloskey said with a malevolent grin ye see i do nt stick at words squire i call things by their names so i perceive answered stevens you were not so bold once ha ha laughed mccloskey i know that as well as you then i was under the thumb that was before we were sailing in the one boat now ye see squire the boot is on the other leg mr stevens remained quiet for a few moments whilst his ragged visitor continued to leisurely sip his brandy and contemplate the soles of his boots as they were reflected in the mirror above they were a
from other neighbors dwelt the friends of herbert greyson the widow rocke and her son traverse no one knew who she was or whence or why she came some fifteen years before she had appeared in town clothed in rusty mourning and accompanied by a boy of about two years of age she had rented that cottage furnished it poorly and had settled there supporting herself and child by needlework at the time that doctor greyson died and his widow and son were left perfectly destitute and it became necessary for mrs greyson to look out for a humble lodging where she could find the united advantages of cheapness cleanliness and pure air she was providentially led to inquire at the cottage of the widow rocke whom she found only too glad to increase her meager income by letting half her little house to such unexceptionable tenants as the widow greyson and her son and thus commenced between the two poor young women and the two boys an acquaintance that ripened into friendship and thence into that devoted love so seldom seen in this world their households became united one fire one candle and one table served the little family and thus considerable expense was saved as well as much social comfort gained and when the lads grew too old to sleep with their mothers one bed held the two boys and the other accommodated the two women and despite toil want care the sorrow for the dead and the neglect of the living this was a loving contented and cheerful little household how much of their private history these women might have confided to each other was not known but it was certain that they continued fast friends up to the time of the death of mrs greyson after which the widow rocke assumed a double burden and became a second mother to the orphan boy until herbert himself ashamed of taxing her small means ran away as he had said and went to sea every year had herbert written to his kind foster mother and his dear brother as he called traverse and at the end of every prosperous voyage when he had a little money he had sent them funds but not always did these letters or remittances reach the widow s cottage and long seasons of intense anxiety would be suffered by her for the fate of her sailor boy as she always called herbert only three times in all these years had herbert found time and means to come down and see them and that was long ago it was many months over two years since they had even received a letter from him and now the poor widow and her son were almost tempted to think that their sailor boy had quite forsaken them it is near the close of a late autumnal evening that i shall introduce you reader into the interior of the widow s cottage you enter by the little wooden gate pass up the moldering paved walk between the old leafless lilac bushes and pass through the front door right into a large clean but poor looking sitting room and kitchen everything was old though neatly and comfortably arranged about this room a faded home made carpet covered the floor a threadbare crimson curtain hung before the window a rickety walnut table dark with age sat under the window against the wall old walnut chairs were placed each side of it old plated candlesticks with the silver all worn off graced the mantelpiece a good fire a cheap comfort in that well wooded country blazed upon the hearth on the right side of the fireplace a few shelves contained some well worn books a flute a few minerals and other little treasures belonging to traverse on the left hand there was a dresser containing the little delfware tea service and plates and dishes of the small family before the fire with her knitting in her hand sat marah rocke watching the kettle as it hung singing over the blaze and the oven of biscuits that sat baking upon the hearth marah rocke was at this time about thirty five years of age and of a singularly refined and delicate aspect for one of her supposed rank her little form slight and flexible as that of a young girl was clothed in a poor but neat black dress relieved by a pure white collar around her throat her jet black hair was parted plainly over her low sweet brow brought down each side her thin cheeks and gathered into a bunch at the back of her shapely little head her face was oval with regular features and pale olive complexion serious lips closed in pensive thought and soft dark brown eyes full of tender affection and sorrowful memories and too often cast down in meditation beneath the heavy shadows of their long thick eyelashes completed the melancholy beauty of a countenance not often seen among the hard working children of toil marah rocke was a very hard working woman sewing all day long and knitting through the twilight and then again resuming her needle by candle light and sewing until midnight and yet marah rocke made but a poor and precarious living for herself and son needlework so ill paid in large cities is even worse paid in the country towns and though the cottage hearth was never cold the widow s meals were often scant lately her son traverse who occasionally earned a trifle of money by doing with all his might whatever his hand could find to do had been engaged by a grocer in the town to deliver his goods to his customers during the illness of the regular porter for which as he was only a substitute he received the very moderate sum of twenty five cents a day this occupation took traverse from home at daybreak in the morning and kept him absent until eight o
was well for me he did not require me to talk i should have betrayed myself if i had attempted it his eyes were riveted on the pair who stood a few yards from us phil bending down was whispering in low tones to his companion in the pink domino there was something in her attitude as she listened with half bent head that i could not fail to recognize and from below the edge of her domino i caught a glimpse of yellow brocade there was but one to whom phil could talk in those earnest tones but one to whom he could tell that tale josephine i saw must have gone upstairs and put on the domino over her first dress the more to puzzle some of her partners kitty had in some way become acquainted with her intention and seized upon it to further the deception that she saw prevailed in regard to me there was very little that escaped that clever jade i wished with a sigh that she were less unscrupulous in a few moments the cousins passed where we sat nearly concealed from them walking slowly and talking earnestly you cannot ask me to endure it longer this suspense is misery he said with a quiver in his manly voice dear phil murmured the clear low tones of his companion you must know my feelings toward you i have never tried to hide them but you know how it is you know it would be madness for either of us to think of each other why would it be madness he urged oh josephine why cannot you give up the ambition that separates us depend upon it it has stood in the way of your happiness all your life it had been impossible to avoid hearing this conversation my companion starting up looked after the retreating figures amazed and stern in his haste he had pulled down an american flag that had been draped over the sofa we occupied i started up and involuntarily raised my hand to replace it the loose sleeve fell back from my arm and in the strong light of the lamp overhead the scar on my wrist caught his eye with a quick imperious movement he seized my hand before i could withdraw it and held it firmly in one of his while with the other he raised my mask you have deceived me he said between his teeth you have deceived yourself you are the victim of your own prejudices you cannot say i did more than humor your decision i returned quickly you only acted a womanly and natural part lied sweetly in every glance of your bright eyes in every turn of your graceful figure in every word on your red lips i do nt blame you you are a woman you are too cruel you will repent this some day it will be the bitterest thing you have to remember the recollection of it will make you suffer as you have made me suffer never fear but i shall have enough to suffer if the present is any earnest of the future for me your kindest wishes will be more than realized for a proud man he said with a low bitter laugh flinging from him the hand he held for a proud man i have had some humiliations that you would hardly believe if i told you you could hardly understand them in your simplicity your soft woman s heart would bleed perhaps but it would heal itself too soon to allay in any great degree my wretchedness your morning glory tenderness would droop before the fierceness of my pain it would die in my hot grasp i will not ask your pity but spare me your detestation save the aversion that your eyes showed then for those who have deserved it better at your hands there was a sound of voices from within a window near us was thrown open and a group of people laughing and talking stepped out on the piazza hastily restoring my mask to its place i turned away and entered the house through the window they had opened you may have deceived one who is indifferent to you you cannot deceive one who loves you said a low voice in my ear and the black figure i instinctively dreaded stood beside me for the sake of heaven come with me one moment who are you i murmured shrinking back he bent down and whispered a name in my ear at which the color left my cheek the light my eye almost the life my pulses will you come i bent my head without a word and followed him out of the hall down the terrace through the winding paths of the shrubbery across the garden hurrying on to suit his fierce pace but chilled to the heart with a terror that was no longer nameless chapter xxxii o man while in thy early years how prodigal of time misspending all thy precious hours thy glorious youthful prime alternate follies take the sway licentious passions burn which tenfold force give nature s law that man was made to mourn burns the spot to which my companion led me was a ruined summerhouse not a stone s throw from the outer garden hedge it was a lonely place in a sort of hollow a low dense orchard stretched dark on one side while a little knoll crowned with copse rose between it and all view of the house and grounds on the other and a little stream fell murmuring down from rock to rock through the ravine why it was so deserted and dilapidated i had never exactly known but from something stephen had said when i had questioned him about it i had conjectured that it was associated with the shame and fall of her whose memory was even yet so painful and that ruin and decay were welcome
lucia it was all they said and wept again quietly aunt martha was dressed in sober black her face was very comely for the hardness that came with a morbid and mistaken zeal was mellowed and the sadness of experience softened it i have lived not far from you lucia all these long years martha and you did not come to me i did not dare listen lucia if a woman who had always gratified her love of admiration and gloried in the power of gratifying it who conquered men and loved to conquer them who was a woman of ungoverned will and indomitable pride should encounter as how often they do a man who utterly conquered her and betrayed her through the very weakness that springs from pride do you not see that such a woman would go near to insanity as i have been believing that i had committed the unpardonable sin and that no punishment could be painful enough mrs bennet looked alarmed no no there is no reason said her sister observing it the man came i could not resist him there was a form of marriage i believed that it was i who had conquered he left me my child was born i appealed to lawrence newt our old friend and playmate he promised me faithful secrecy and through him the child was sent where gabriel was at school then i withdrew from both i thought it was the will of god i felt myself commanded to a living death dead to every friend and kinsman dead to every thing but my degradation and its punishment and yet consciously close to you near to all old haunts and familiar faces lost to them all lost to my child her voice faltered and the tears gushed from her eyes but i persevered the old passionate pride was changed to a kind of religious frenzy lawrence newt went and came to and from india i was utterly lost to the world i knew that my child would never know me for lawrence had promised that he would not betray me and when i disappeared from his view lawrence gradually came to consider me dead then amy discovered me among the poor souls she visited and through amy lawrence newt and by them i have been led out of the valley of the shadow of death and see the blessed light of love once more she bowed her head in uncontrollable emotion and your son said her sister half smiling through her sympathetic tears will be yours also amy tells me said aunt martha thank god thank god martha who gave him his name asked mrs bennet aunt martha paused for a little while then she said you never knew who my my husband was never i remember he never came to the house well i gave my child almost his father s name i called him wynne his father s name was wayne mrs bennet clasped her hands in her lap how wonderful how wonderful was all she said lawrence newt knocked at the door and amy and he came in there was so sweet and strange a light upon amy s face that mrs bennet looked at her in surprise then she looked at lawrence newt and he cheerfully returned her glance with that smiling musing expression in his eyes that was utterly bewildering to mrs bennet she could only look at each of the persons before her and repeat her last words how wonderful how wonderful amy waring who had not heard the previous conversation between her two aunts blushed as she heard these words as if mrs bennet had been alluding to something in which amy was particularly interested amy said mrs bennet amy could scarcely raise her eyes there was an exquisite maidenly shyness overspreading her whole person at length she looked the response she could not speak how could you asked her aunt poor amy was utterly unable to reply coming and going in my house my dearest niece and yet hugging such a secret and holding your tongue oh amy amy these were the words of reproach but the tone and look and impression were of entire love and sympathy lawrence newt looked calmly on aunt lucia what could i do was all that amy could say well well i do not reproach you i blame nobody i am too glad and happy it is too wonderful wonderful there was a fullness and intensity of emphasis in what she said that apparently made amy suspect that she had not correctly understood her aunt s intention oh you mean about aunt martha said amy with an air of relief and surprise lawrence newt smiled mrs bennet turned to amy with a fresh look of inquiry about aunt martha of course about aunt martha why amy what on earth did you suppose it was about again the overwhelming impossibility to reply mrs bennet was very curious she looked at her sister martha who was smiling intelligently then at lawrence newt who did not cease smiling as if he were in no perplexity whatsoever then at amy who sat smiling at her through the tears that had gathered in the thoughtful womanly brown eyes let me speak said lawrence newt quietly why should we not all be glad and happy with you you have found a sister aunt martha has found herself and a son i have found a wife and amy a husband they returned to the room where they had left the guests and the story was quietly told to hope wayne and the others hope and edward looked at each other little malacca she said in a low tone putting out her hand sister hope said the young man blushing and his large eyes filling with tenderness and my sister too whispered ellen bennet as she took hope s other hand chapter lxxxiii mrs delilah jones mr newt s political friends
house for them giving little parties and large ones which were pleasant to everybody except cousin charles who detested company it made him lie so but he was very well satisfied that people should like to visit and praise his house and its belongings if alice would take the trouble of it upon herself i made calls with her wednesday afternoons and went to church with her sunday mornings at home i saw little of her she was almost exclusively occupied with the children their ailments or their pleasures and staid in her own room or the nursery when in the house i never occupied one spot long but wandered in the garden which had a row of elms or haunted the kitchen and stables to watch black phoebe the cook or the men as they cleaned the horses or carriages my own room was in a wing of the cottage with a window overlooking the entrance into the yard and the carriage drive this was its sole view except the wall of a house on the other side of a high fence i heard charles when he drove home at night or away in the morning knew when nell was in a bad humor by the tone of his voice which i heard whether my window was open or shut it was a pretty room with a set of maple furniture and amber and white wallpaper and amber and white chintz curtains and coverings it suited the color of my hair alice declared and was becoming to my complexion yes said charles looking at my hair with an expression that made me put my hand up to my head as if to hide it i knew it was carelessly dressed i made a study that day of the girls heads at school and from that time improved in my style of wearing it and i brushed it with zeal every day afterward alice had my room kept so neatly for me that it soon came to be a reproach and i was finally taught by her example how to adjust chairs books and mats in straight lines to fold articles without making odd corners and wrinkles at last i improved so much that i could find what i was seeking in a drawer without harrowing it with my fingers and began to see beauty in order alice had a talent for housekeeping and her talent was fostered by the exacting systematic taste of her husband he examined many matters which are usually left to women and he applied his business talent to the art of living succeeding in it as he did in everything else alice told me that charles had been poor that his father was never on good terms with him she fancied they were too much alike so he had turned him off to shift for himself when quite young when she met him he was the agent of a manufacturing company in the town where her parents lived and even then in his style of living he surpassed the young men of her acquaintance the year before they were married his father died and as charles was his only child he left his farm to him and ten thousand dollars all he had the executors of the will were obliged to advertise for him not having any clue to his place of residence he sold the farm as soon as it was put in his hands took the ten thousand dollars and came back to be married a year after he went to rosville and built a cotton factory three miles from town and the cottage and then brought her and edward who was a few months old to live in it he had since enlarged the works employed more operatives and was making a great deal of money morgeson s mills she believed were known all over the country charles was his own agent as well as sole owner there were no mills beside his in the neighborhood to that fact she ascribed the reason of his having no difficulties in rosville and no enmities for she knew he had no wish to make friends the rosville people having no business in common with him had no right to meddle and could find but small excuse for comment they spent she said five or six thousand a year most of it went in horses she was convinced and she believed his flowers cost him a great deal too you must know cassandra that his heart is with his horses and his flowers he is more interested in them than he is in his children she looked vexed when she said this but i took hold of the edge of her finely embroidered cape and asked her how much it cost she laughed and said fifty dollars but you see how many lapels it has i have still a handsomer one that was seventy five are they a part of the six thousand a year alice of course but charles wishes me to dress and never stints me in money and after all i like for him to spend his money in his own way it vexes me sometimes he buys such wild brutes and endangers his life with them he rides miles and miles every year and it relieves the tedium of his journeys to have horses he must watch i suppose nobody in rosville lived at so fast a rate as the morgesons the oldest families there were not the richest the ryders in particular judge ryder had four unmarried daughters they were the only girls in our set who never invited us to visit them they could not help saying with a fork of the neck who are the morgesons but all the others welcomed cousin alice and were friendly with me she was too pretty and kind hearted not to be liked if she was rich and cousin charles was respected
was hurriedly summoned to his aid was summoned quite as much in the capacity of friend as in that of medical attendant the story of life or death was soon told the merchant had believed from the moment of attack that his day of probation was over and apart from his natural anxiety for the welfare of his only child there was little tie to bind the sufferer to earth his wife his wife that day as much as she had been at any period of their wedded life had long been awaiting him as he believed in a better world and there is something in the facility with which those quiet good people who seem never to have enjoyed existence with the fiery zest which tingles in finger and lip of the sons of pleasure and sorrow give up their hold upon being and pass away into the infinite unknown which lies beyond the dark valley something that may well make it a matter of question whether theirs is not after all the golden secret of human happiness for which all ages have been studying and delving the doctor came with that rapidity which was usual with him and with every mark of intense interest on his face and in his general demeanor he found the invalid sinking rapidly and his attendants the weeping eleanor then a handsome promising but defectively educated girl of near eighteen and two or three of the ladies of the near neighborhood who had gathered in to tender their services when it was known that the merchant had been brought home in a dying condition a few words from the sufferer uttered in a low tone almost in the ear of the stooping physician and then all the others were sent out of the room except his daughter whose pleading gesture asking to be allowed to remain within the room was not disregarded but who was motioned by the doctor to take her place at the window beyond supposed hearing of the words that were to pass between the two friends tell me the exact truth said the low voice of nicholas hill when these dispositions had been made i am prepared to hear any judgment which your lips may speak there is no hope for me i am dying either the doctor could not speak or he would not he merely bowed his head in a manner that the questioner well understood so i thought from the first said the dying man the life blood does not flow away in that manner for nothing and i do not know that i regret the end for i have lived almost as long as i could make myself useful and i think i am as nearly prepared to die as poor fallen humanity can hope to be i hope and believe that you are indeed prepared to die my dear good friend answered the doctor with feeling in his tone and the feeble hand of the sufferer meanwhile within his i cannot hold out a false hope to you you cannot live how gladly science and friendship would both join hands in doing something to keep you in the world you know but how much we shall all miss you and grieve for you you do not know that you will miss me i hope said the dying man but there is no occasion whatever to grieve for me it is a peaceful end i think and in god s own good time i have but one anxiety he paused and the doctor nodded his head towards the side of the room where poor eleanor was sitting trying to distract her own thoughts by looking out of the window the father saw that he understood him and pressed the hand that he held yes you have guessed rightly he said my only anxiety is for the fate of my child eleanor is a good girl but she is yet very young and she will need protection she shall find it said the doctor solemnly the face of the dying man lit up with an expression of the sincerest pleasure and happiness and his feeble grasp again pressed the hand of high health which lay so near his own ebbing pulse i believe you and i thank you my friend as well as physician he replied i have not been afraid to think of this day as they tell me that so many are and my affairs are in some degree prepared for it i have a handsome property though not a large one and you will find a will lying in the private drawer of the safe at the store with the exception of a few legacies to friends a small one to yourself included it all goes to eleanor and you will find yourself named my executor a confidence which flatters me and which i hope i shall deserve said the doctor as the enfeebled man again paused for a moment i know that you will the sufferer resumed thanks to my property eleanor will not be a burthen to you except in the demand of care her few relatives as you know are distant ones and none of them reside nearer than california there will be none to interfere with you in guiding her aright keeping her pure in her remaining years of girlhood and watching over her until she becomes the wife of some honorable man or in some other way ceases to need your protection i accept the charge as freely as it is given and i will perform it as i would for one of my own blood was the solemn answer of the medical man i knew that before i asked or i should never have asked at all said the dying man eleanor my daughter come here the young girl obeyed and knelt beside the bed striving to restrain her sobs and tears the father laid his hand
hans and gretel on a bright december morning long ago two thinly clad children were kneeling upon the bank of a frozen canal in holland the sun had not yet appeared but the gray sky was parted near the horizon and its edges shone crimson with the coming day most of the good hollanders were enjoying a placid morning nap even mynheer von stoppelnoze that worthy old dutchman was still slumbering in beautiful repose now and then some peasant woman poising a well filled basket upon her head came skimming over the glassy surface of the canal or a lusty boy skating to his day s work in the town cast a good natured grimace toward the shivering pair as he flew along meanwhile with many a vigorous puff and pull the brother and sister for such they were seemed to be fastening something to their feet not skates certainly but clumsy pieces of wood narrowed and smoothed at their lower edge and pierced with holes through which were threaded strings of rawhide these queer looking affairs had been made by the boy hans his mother was a poor peasant woman too poor even to think of such a thing as buying skates for her little ones rough as these were they had afforded the children many a happy hour upon the ice and now as with cold red fingers our young hollanders tugged at the strings their solemn faces bending closely over their knees no vision of impossible iron runners came to dull the satisfaction glowing within in a moment the boy arose and with a pompous swing of the arms and a careless come on gretel glided easily across the canal ah hans called his sister plaintively this foot is not well yet the strings hurt me on last market day and now i cannot bear them tied in the same place tie them higher up then answered hans as without looking at her he performed a wonderful cat s cradle step on the ice how can i the string is too short giving vent to a good natured dutch whistle the english of which was that girls were troublesome creatures he steered toward her you are foolish to wear such shoes gretel when you have a stout leather pair your klompen wooden shoes would be better than these why hans do you forget the father threw my beautiful new shoes in the fire before i knew what he had done they were all curled up in the midst o the burning peat i can skate with these but not with my wooden ones be careful now hans had taken a string from his pocket humming a tune as he knelt beside her he proceeded to fasten gretel s skate with all the force of his strong young arm oh oh she cried in real pain with an impatient jerk hans unwound the string he would have cast it on the ground in true big brother style had he not just then spied a tear trickling down his sister s cheek i ll fix it never fear he said with sudden tenderness but we must be quick the mother will need us soon then he glanced inquiringly about him first at the ground next at some bare willow branches above his head and finally at the sky now gorgeous with streaks of blue crimson and gold finding nothing in any of these localities to meet his need his eye suddenly brightened as with the air of a fellow who knew what he was about he took off his cap and removing the tattered lining adjusted it in a smooth pad over the top of gretel s worn out shoe now he cried triumphantly at the same time arranging the strings as briskly as his benumbed fingers would allow can you bear some pulling gretel drew up her lips as if to say hurt away but made no further response in another moment they were all laughing together as hand in hand they flew along the canal never thinking whether the ice would bear them or not for in holland ice is generally an all winter affair it settles itself upon the water in a determined kind of way and so far from growing thin and uncertain every time the sun is a little severe upon it it gathers its forces day by day and flashes defiance to every beam presently squeak squeak sounded something beneath hans feet next his strokes grew shorter ending oftimes with a jerk and finally he lay sprawling upon the ice kicking against the air with many a fantastic flourish ha ha laughed gretel that was a fine tumble but a tender heart was beating under her coarse blue jacket and even as she laughed she came with a graceful sweep close to her prostrate brother are you hurt hans oh you are laughing catch me now and she darted away shivering no longer but with cheeks all aglow and eyes sparkling with fun hans sprang to his feet and started in brisk pursuit but it was no easy thing to catch gretel before she had traveled very far her skates too began to squeak believing that discretion was the better part of valor she turned suddenly and skated into her pursuer s arms ha ha i ve caught you cried hans ha ha i caught you she retorted struggling to free herself just then a clear quick voice was heard calling hans gretel it s the mother said hans looking solemn in an instant by this time the canal was gilded with sunlight the pure morning air was very delightful and skaters were gradually increasing in numbers it was hard to obey the summons but gretel and hans were good children without a thought of yielding to the temptation to linger they pulled off their skates leaving half the knots still tied hans with his great square shoulders and bushy yellow hair towered
failure and yet looking at the subject soberly there was not the slightest prospect of success martha deane was the girl in the old man s mind and an instinct stronger than his vanity told him that she never would or could be his wife but in spite of that it must be his business to create a contrary impression and keep it alive as long as possible perhaps until until we all know what was in his mind until the old man should die chapter v guests at fairthorn s the fairthorn farm was immediately north of kennett square for the first mile towards unionville the rich rolling fields which any traveller may see to this day on either side of the road belonged to it the house stood on the right in the hollow into which the road dips on leaving the village originally a large cabin of hewn logs it now rejoiced in a stately stone addition overgrown with ivy up to the eaves and a long porch in front below which two mounds of box guarded the flight of stone steps leading down to the garden the hill in the rear kept off the north wind and this garden caught the earliest warmth of spring nowhere else in the neighborhood did the crocuses bloom so early or the peas so soon appear above ground the lack of order the air of old neglect about the place in nowise detracted from its warm cosy character it was a pleasant nook and the relatives and friends of the family whose name was legion always liked to visit there several days had elapsed since the chase and the eventful evening which followed it it was baking day and the plump arms of sally fairthorn were floury white up to the elbows she was leaning over the dough trough plunging her fists furiously into the spongy mass when she heard a step on the porch although her gown was pinned up leaving half of her short striped petticoat visible and a blue and white spotted handkerchief concealed her dark hair sally did not stop to think of that she rushed into the front room just as a gaunt female figure passed the window at the sight of which she clapped her hands so that the flour flew in a little white cloud and two or three strips of dough peeled off her arms and fell upon the floor the front door opened and our old friend miss betsy lavender walked into the room any person between kildeer hill and hockessin who did not know miss betsy must have been an utter stranger to the country or an idiot she had a marvellous clairvoyant faculty for the approach of either joy or grief and always turned up just at the moment when she was most wanted profession had she none neither a permanent home but for twenty years she had wandered hither and thither in highly independent fashion turning her hand to whatever seemed to require its cunning a better housekeeper never might have lived if she could have stuck to one spot an admirable cook nurse seamstress and spinner she refused alike the high wages of wealthy farmers and the hands of poor widowers she had a little money of her own but never refused payment from those who were able to give it in order that she might now and then make a present of her services to poorer friends her speech was blunt and rough her ways odd and eccentric her name was rarely mentioned without a laugh but those who laughed at her esteemed her none the less in those days of weekly posts and one newspaper she was politics art science and literature to many families in person miss betsy lavender was peculiar rather than attractive she was nearly if not quite fifty years of age rather tall and a little stoop shouldered her face at first sight suggested that of a horse with its long ridged nose loose lips and short chin her eyes were dull gray set near together and much sharper in their operation than a stranger would suppose over a high narrow forehead she wore thin bands of tan colored hair somewhat grizzled and forming a coil at the back of her head barely strong enough to hold the teeth of an enormous tortoise shell comb yet her grotesqueness had nothing repellant it was a genial caricature at which no one could take offence the very person i wanted to see cried sally father and mother are going up to uncle john s this afternoon aunt eliza has an old woman s quilting party and they ll stay all night and however am i to manage joe and jake by myself martha s half promised to come but not till after supper it will all go right since you are here come into mother s room and take off your things well said miss betsy with a snort that s to be my business eh i ll have my hands full a pearter couple o lads a nt to be found this side o nottin gam they might ha growed up wild on the barrens for all the manners they ve got sally knew that this criticism was true also that miss betsy s task was no sinecure and she therefore thought it best to change the subject there said she as miss betsy gave the thin rope of her back hair a fierce twist and jammed her high comb inward and outward that the teeth might catch there now you ll do come into the kitchen and tell me the news while i set my loaves to rise loaves to rise echoed miss betsy seating herself on a tall rush bottomed chair near the window she had an incorrigible habit of repeating the last three words of the person with whom she spoke a habit which was sometimes mimicked good humoredly
bank books were kept and opening it brought them out for inspection it was found that dick had the sum of eighteen dollars and ninety cents placed to his credit while fosdick had six dollars and forty five cents to explain the large difference it must be remembered that dick had deposited five dollars before henry deposited anything being the amount he had received as a gift from mr whitney how much does that make the lot of it asked dick i aint much on figgers yet you know it makes twenty five dollars and thirty five cents dick said his companion who did not understand the thought which suggested the question take it and buy some clothes henry said dick shortly what your money too in course no dick you are too generous i could nt think of it almost three quarters of the money is yours you must spend it on yourself i do nt need it said dick you may not need it now but you will some time i shall have some more then that may be but it would nt be fair for me to use your money dick i thank you all the same for your kindness well i ll lend it to you then persisted dick and you can pay me when you get to be a rich merchant but it is nt likely i ever shall be one how d you know i went to a fortun teller once and she told me i was born under a lucky star with a hard name and i should have a rich man for my particular friend who would make my fortun i guess you are going to be the rich man fosdick laughed and steadily refused for some time to avail himself of dick s generous proposal but at length perceiving that our hero seemed much disappointed and would be really glad if his offer were accepted he agreed to use as much as might be needful this at once brought back dick s good humor and he entered with great enthusiasm into his friend s plans the next day they withdrew the money from the bank and when business got a little slack in the afternoon set out in search of a clothing store dick knew enough of the city to be able to find a place where a good bargain could be obtained he was determined that fosdick should have a good serviceable suit even if it took all the money they had the result of their search was that for twenty three dollars fosdick obtained a very neat outfit including a couple of shirts a hat and a pair of shoes besides a dark mixed suit which appeared stout and of good quality shall i send the bundle home asked the salesman impressed by the off hand manner in which dick drew out the money in payment for the clothes thank you said dick you re very kind but i ll take it home myself and you can allow me something for my trouble all right said the clerk laughing i ll allow it on your next purchase proceeding to their apartment in mott street fosdick at once tried on his new suit and it was found to be an excellent fit dick surveyed his new friend with much satisfaction you look like a young gentleman of fortun he said and do credit to your governor i suppose that means you dick said fosdick laughing in course it does you should say of course said fosdick who in virtue of his position as dick s tutor ventured to correct his language from time to time how dare you correct your gov nor said dick with comic indignation i ll cut you off with a shillin you young dog as the markis says to his nephew in the play at the old bowery chapter xix fosdick changes his business fosdick did not venture to wear his new clothes while engaged in his business this he felt would have been wasteful extravagance about ten o clock in the morning when business slackened he went home and dressing himself went to a hotel where he could see copies of the morning herald and sun and noting down the places where a boy was wanted went on a round of applications but he found it no easy thing to obtain a place swarms of boys seemed to be out of employment and it was not unusual to find from fifty to a hundred applicants for a single place there was another difficulty it was generally desired that the boy wanted should reside with his parents when fosdick on being questioned revealed the fact of his having no parents and being a boy of the street this was generally sufficient of itself to insure a refusal merchants were afraid to trust one who had led such a vagabond life dick who was always ready for an emergency suggested borrowing a white wig and passing himself off for fosdick s father or grandfather but henry thought this might be rather a difficult character for our hero to sustain after fifty applications and as many failures fosdick began to get discouraged there seemed to be no way out of his present business for which he felt unfitted i do nt know but i shall have to black boots all my life he said one day despondently to dick keep a stiff upper lip said dick by the time you get to be a gray headed veteran you may get a chance to run errands for some big firm on the bowery which is a very cheerin reflection so dick by his drollery and perpetual good spirits kept up fosdick s courage as for me said dick i expect by that time to lay up a colossal fortun out of shines and live in princely style on the avenoo but one morning fosdick straying into french s hotel
just going to rehearse the dignified exit when a step in the hall made her fly into her seat and begin to sew as fast as if her life depended on finishing that particular seam in a given time jo smothered a laugh at the sudden change and when someone gave a modest tap opened the door with a grim aspect which was anything but hospitable good afternoon i came to get my umbrella that is to see how your father finds himself today said mr brooke getting a trifle confused as his eyes went from one telltale face to the other it s very well he s in the rack i ll get him and tell it you are here and having jumbled her father and the umbrella well together in her reply jo slipped out of the room to give meg a chance to make her speech and air her dignity but the instant she vanished meg began to sidle toward the door murmuring mother will like to see you pray sit down i ll call her do nt go are you afraid of me margaret and mr brooke looked so hurt that meg thought she must have done something very rude she blushed up to the little curls on her forehead for he had never called her margaret before and she was surprised to find how natural and sweet it seemed to hear him say it anxious to appear friendly and at her ease she put out her hand with a confiding gesture and said gratefully how can i be afraid when you have been so kind to father i only wish i could thank you for it shall i tell you how asked mr brooke holding the small hand fast in both his own and looking down at meg with so much love in the brown eyes that her heart began to flutter and she both longed to run away and to stop and listen oh no please do nt i d rather not she said trying to withdraw her hand and looking frightened in spite of her denial i wo nt trouble you i only want to know if you care for me a little meg i love you so much dear added mr brooke tenderly this was the moment for the calm proper speech but meg did nt make it she forgot every word of it hung her head and answered i do nt know so softly that john had to stoop down to catch the foolish little reply he seemed to think it was worth the trouble for he smiled to himself as if quite satisfied pressed the plump hand gratefully and said in his most persuasive tone will you try and find out i want to know so much for i ca nt go to work with any heart until i learn whether i am to have my reward in the end or not i m too young faltered meg wondering why she was so fluttered yet rather enjoying it i ll wait and in the meantime you could be learning to like me would it be a very hard lesson dear not if i chose to learn it but please choose to learn meg i love to teach and this is easier than german broke in john getting possession of the other hand so that she had no way of hiding her face as he bent to look into it his tone was properly beseeching but stealing a shy look at him meg saw that his eyes were merry as well as tender and that he wore the satisfied smile of one who had no doubt of his success this nettled her annie moffat s foolish lessons in coquetry came into her mind and the love of power which sleeps in the bosoms of the best of little women woke up all of a sudden and took possession of her she felt excited and strange and not knowing what else to do followed a capricious impulse and withdrawing her hands said petulantly i do nt choose please go away and let me be poor mr brooke looked as if his lovely castle in the air was tumbling about his ears for he had never seen meg in such a mood before and it rather bewildered him do you really mean that he asked anxiously following her as she walked away yes i do i do nt want to be worried about such things father says i need nt it s too soon and i d rather not may nt i hope you ll change your mind by and by i ll wait and say nothing till you have had more time do nt play with me meg i did nt think that of you do nt think of me at all i d rather you would nt said meg taking a naughty satisfaction in trying her lover s patience and her own power he was grave and pale now and looked decidedly more like the novel heroes whom she admired but he neither slapped his forehead nor tramped about the room as they did he just stood looking at her so wistfully so tenderly that she found her heart relenting in spite of herself what would have happened next i cannot say if aunt march had not come hobbling in at this interesting minute the old lady could nt resist her longing to see her nephew for she had met laurie as she took her airing and hearing of mr march s arrival drove straight out to see him the family were all busy in the back part of the house and she had made her way quietly in hoping to surprise them she did surprise two of them so much that meg started as if she had seen a ghost and mr brooke vanished into the study bless me what s all this cried the old lady with a rap
folly that was creeping over me for during the long silent ride i had examined my conduct from every stand point and there was no view i could take of myself in which i did not look like a very foolish person indeed as we came within sight of the spires of rivermouth i would nt have cared if the up train which met us outside the town had run into us and ended me contrary to my expectation and dread the captain was not visible when we stepped from the cars sailor ben glanced among the crowd of faces apparently looking for him too conway was there he was always hanging about the station and if he had intimated in any way that he knew of my disgrace and enjoyed it i should have walked into him i am certain but this defiant feeling entirely deserted me by the time we reached the nutter house the captain himself opened the door come on board sir said sailor ben scraping his left foot and touching his hat sea fashion my grandfather nodded to sailor ben somewhat coldly i thought and much to my astonishment kindly took me by the hand i was unprepared for this and the tears which no amount of severity would have wrung from me welled up to my eyes the expression of my grandfather s face as i glanced at it hastily was grave and gentle there was nothing in it of anger or reproof i followed him into the sitting room and obeying a motion of his hand seated myself on the sofa he remained standing by the round table for a moment lost in thought then leaned over and picked up a letter it was a letter with a great black seal chapter twenty one in which i leave rivermouth a letter with a great black seal i knew then what had happened as well as i know it now but which was it father or mother i do not like to look back to the agony and suspense of that moment my father had died at new orleans during one of his weekly visits to the city the letter bearing these tidings had reached rivermouth the evening of my flight had passed me on the road by the down train i must turn back for a moment to that eventful evening when i failed to make my appearance at supper the captain began to suspect that i had really started on my wild tour southward a conjecture which sailor ben s absence helped to confirm i had evidently got off by the train and sailor ben had followed me there was no telegraphic communication between boston and rivermouth in those days so my grandfather could do nothing but await the result even if there had been another mail to boston he could not have availed himself of it not knowing how to address a message to the fugitives the post office was naturally the last place either i or the admiral would think of visiting my grandfather however was too full of trouble to allow this to add to his distress he knew that the faithful old sailor would not let me come to any harm and even if i had managed for the time being to elude him was sure to bring me back sooner or later our return therefore by the first train on the following day did not surprise him i was greatly puzzled as i have said by the gentle manner of his reception but when we were alone together in the sitting room and he began slowly to unfold the letter i understood it all i caught a sight of my mother s handwriting in the superscription and there was nothing left to tell me my grandfather held the letter a few seconds irresolutely and then commenced reading it aloud but he could get no further than the date i ca nt read it tom said the old gentleman breaking down i thought i could he handed it to me i took the letter mechanically and hurried away with it to my little room where i had passed so many happy hours the week that followed the receipt of this letter is nearly a blank in my memory i remember that the days appeared endless that at times i could not realize the misfortune that had befallen us and my heart upbraided me for not feeling a deeper grief that a full sense of my loss would now and then sweep over me like an inspiration and i would steal away to my chamber or wander forlornly about the gardens i remember this but little more as the days went by my first grief subsided and in its place grew up a want which i have experienced at every step in life from boyhood to manhood often even now after all these years when i see a lad of twelve or fourteen walking by his father s side and glancing merrily up at his face i turn and look after them and am conscious that i have missed companionship most sweet and sacred i shall not dwell on this portion of my story there were many tranquil pleasant hours in store for me at that period and i prefer to turn to them one evening the captain came smiling into the sitting room with an open letter in his hand my mother had arrived at new york and would be with us the next day for the first time in weeks years it seemed to me something of the old cheerfulness mingled with our conversation round the evening lamp i was to go to boston with the captain to meet her and bring her home i need not describe that meeting with my mother s hand in mine once more all the long years we had been parted appeared like a dream very dear to me was the
might do with a sheriff was a question i must not detain the reader to tell how the mob rose nobody knows how such things come about their origin is as inexplicable as that of an earthquake but at any rate a rope was twice put round small s neck during that night and both times small was saved only by the nerve and address of ralph who had learned how unjust mob law may be as for small he neither trembled when they were ready to hang him nor looked relieved when he was saved nor showed the slightest flush of penitence or gratitude he bore himself in a quiet gentlemanly way throughout like the admirable villain that he was he waived a preliminary examination the next day his father went his bail and he forfeited bail and disappeared from the county and from the horizon of my story two reports concerning small have been in circulation one that he was running a faro bank in san francisco the other that he was curing consumption in new york by some quack process if this latter were true it would leave it an open question whether ralph did well to save him from the gallows pete jones and bill as usually happens to the rougher villains went to prison and when their terms had expired moved to pike county missouri but it is about hannah that you wish to hear and that i wish to tell she went straight from the court room to flat creek climbed to her chamber packed in a handkerchief all her earthly goods consisting chiefly of a few family relics and turned her back on the house of means forever at the gate she met the old woman who shook her fist in the girl s face and gave her a parting benediction in the words you mis able ongrateful critter you go long i m glad to be shed of you at the barn she met bud and he told her good by with a little huskiness in his voice while a tear glistened in her eyes bud had been a friend in need and such a friend one does not leave without a pang where are you going can i no no and with that she hastened on afraid that bud would offer to hitch up the roan colt and she did not want to add to his domestic unhappiness by compromising him in that way it was dusk and was raining when she left the hours were long the road was lonely and after the revelations of that day it did not seem wholly safe but from the moment that she found herself free her heart had been ready to break with an impatient homesickness what though there might be robbers in the woods what though there were ten rough miles to travel what though the rain was in her face what though she had not tasted food since the morning of that exciting day flat creek and bondage were behind freedom mother shocky and home were before her and her feet grew lighter with the thought and if she needed any other joy it was to know that the master was clear and he would come and so she traversed the weary distance and so she inquired and found the house the beautiful homely old house of beautiful homely old nancy sawyer and knocked and was admitted and fell down faint and weary at her blind mother s feet and laid her tired head in her mother s lap and wept and wept like a child and said o mother i m free i m free while the mother s tears baptized her face and the mother s trembling fingers combed out her tresses and shocky stood by her and cried i knowed god would nt forget you hanner hannah was ready now to do anything by which she could support her mother and shocky she was strong and inured to toil she was willing and cheerful and she would gladly have gone to service if by that means she could have supported the family and for that matter her mother was already able nearly to support herself by her knitting but hannah had been carefully educated when young and at that moment the old public schools were being organized into a graded school and the good minister who shall be nameless because he is perhaps still living in indiana and who in methodist parlance was called the preacher in charge of lewisburg station this good minister and miss nancy sawyer got hannah a place as teacher in the primary department and then a little house with four rooms was rented and a little a very little furniture was put into it and the old sweet home was established again the father was gone never to come back again but the rest were here and somehow hannah kept waiting for somebody else to come chapter xxxiii into the light for two weeks longer ralph taught at the flat creek school house he was everybody s hero and he was bud s idol he did what he could to get bud and martha together and though bud always saw her safe home after this and called on her every sunday evening yet to save his life he could not forget his big fists and his big feet long enough to say what he most wanted to say and what martha most wanted him to say at the end of two weeks ralph found himself exceedingly weary of flat creek and exceedingly glad to hear from mr means that the school money had gin out it gave him a good excuse to return to lewisburg where his heart and his treasure were a certain sense of delicacy had kept him from writing to hannah just yet when he got to lewisburg he had good news his uncle ashamed of his previous neglect and
cecy was pleased and dorry and john kicked their heels on the ground in a tumult of joy seven pairs of hands were held out at once toward the basket seven sets of teeth went to work without a moment s delay in an incredibly short time every vestige of pie had disappeared and a blissful stickiness pervaded the party what shall we do now asked clover while little phil tipped the baskets upside down as if to make sure there was nothing left that could possibly be eaten i do nt know replied katy dreamily she had left her seat and was half sitting half lying on the low crooked bough of a butternut tree which hung almost over the children s heads let s play we re grown up said cecy and tell what we mean to do well said clover you begin what do you mean to do i mean to have a black silk dress and pink roses in my bonnet and a white muslin long shawl said cecy and i mean to look exactly like minerva clark i shall be very good too as good as mrs bedell only a great deal prettier all the young gentlemen will want me to go and ride but i sha nt notice them at all because you know i shall always be teaching in sunday school and visiting the poor and some day when i am bending over an old woman and feeding her with currant jelly a poet will come along and see me and he ll go home and write a poem about me concluded cecy triumphantly pooh said clover i do nt think that would be nice at all i m going to be a beautiful lady the most beautiful lady in the world and i m going to live in a yellow castle with yellow pillars to the portico and a square thing on top like mr sawyer s my children are going to have a play house up there there s going to be a spy glass in the window to look out of i shall wear gold dresses and silver dresses every day and diamond rings and have white satin aprons to tie on when i m dusting or doing anything dirty in the middle of my back yard there will be a pond full of lubin s extracts and whenever i want any i shall just go out and dip a bottle in and i sha nt teach in sunday schools like cecy because i do nt want to but every sunday i ll go and stand by the gate and when her scholars go by on their way home i ll put lubin s extracts on their handkerchiefs i mean to have just the same cried elsie whose imagination was fired by this gorgeous vision only my pond will be the biggest i shall be a great deal beautifuller too she added you ca nt said katy from overhead clover is going to be the most beautiful lady in the world but i ll be more beautiful than the most beautiful persisted poor little elsie and i ll be big too and know everybody s secrets and everybody ll be kind then and never run away and hide and there wo nt be any post offices or anything disagreeable what ll you be johnnie asked clover anxious to change the subject for elsie s voice was growing plaintive but johnnie had no clear ideas as to her future she laughed a great deal and squeezed dorry s arm very tight but that was all dorry was more explicit i mean to have turkey every day he declared and batter puddings not boiled ones you know but little baked ones with brown shiny tops and a great deal of pudding sauce to eat on them and i shall be so big then that nobody will say three helps is quite enough for a little boy oh dorry you pig cried katy while the others screamed with laughter dorry was much affronted i shall just go and tell aunt izzie what you called me he said getting up in a great pet but clover who was a born peacemaker caught hold of his arm and her coaxing and entreaties consoled him so much that he finally said he would stay especially as the others were quite grave now and promised that they would nt laugh any more and now katy it s your turn said cecy tell us what you re going to be when you grow up i m not sure about what i ll be replied katy from overhead beautiful of course and good if i can only not so good as you cecy because it would be nice to go and ride with the young gentlemen sometimes and i d like to have a large house and a splendiferous garden and then you could all come and live with me and we would play in the garden and dorry should have turkey five times a day if he liked and we d have a machine to darn the stockings and another machine to put the bureau drawers in order and we d never sew or knit garters or do anything we did nt want to that s what i d like to be but now i ll tell you what i mean to do is nt it the same thing asked cecy oh no replied katy quite different for you see i mean to do something grand i do nt know what yet but when i m grown up i shall find out poor katy always said when i m grown up forgetting how very much she had grown already perhaps she went on it will be rowing out in boats and saving peoples lives like that girl in the book or perhaps i shall go and nurse in the hospital like miss nightingale or else i ll head
still spat a mosquito which after considerable reconnoitring had settled upon bressant s broad hand had sacrificed its life to rescue cornelia from her dilemma bressant felt the soft warm fingers strike smartly and then begin to remove cautiously and slowly because the mosquito was possibly not dead after all what was the matter with the young man his blood and senses seemed to quiver and tingle with a sensation at once delicious and confusing in the same instant he had seized the soft warm fingers in both his hands and pressed them convulsively and almost fiercely cornelia very naturally cried out and sprang to her feet bressant it would seem not so naturally did the same thing and with the air of being to the full as much astonished and startled as she what do you mean sir how dare you she said paling after her first deep flush he looked at her and then at his own hand on which the accommodating mosquito was artistically flattened and then at her again with a slight interrogative frown how did it happen what was it i did nt mean it cornelia was quite at a loss what to do or say under such extraordinary circumstances she felt short of breath and indignant but she had never heard of a young man s questioning a lady as to how he had come to take a liberty with her as she stood thus confounded her unfortunate perception of the ludicrous betrayed her once more but this time her recent shock played a part in it and came very near producing a bad fit of hysterics bressant looked on without a word or a motion in less than a minute for cornelia s nerves were very strong and had never been overtaxed she had regained command of herself bressant was standing between her and the house and she pointed up the path please go home as quickly as possible off he walked with every symptom of readiness and relief cornelia followed after but when she reached the house she found her papa staring inquiringly out of his study door the uncanny pupil in divinity had disappeared chapter vi cornelia begins to undo a knot bressant to do him justice for he was on the whole rather apt to be polite than otherwise in his way entirely forgot the professor s existence for the time being he was too self absorbed to think of other people he thought he was bewitched and felt a strong and healthy impulse to throw off the witchery before doing any thing else he sprang up the steps across the balcony traversed the hall with a quick tramp that shook the house snatched his hat from the old hat tree came down upon the porch step which creaked in a paroxysm of reproach at his unaccustomed weight and in another moment stood outside the parsonage gate which to save time he had leaped instead of opening the road was white no longer but brown and moist the sky overhead was deep purple and full of stars the air wafted about hither and thither in little cool damp puffs which were a luxury to inhale bressant drew in two or three long lungfuls then setting his round straw hat more firmly on his head he leaned slightly forward and launched himself into a long swinging run to run gracefully and well is a rare accomplishment for it demands a particularly well adjusted physical organization great strength and a deep breath reservoir bressant s body poised itself lightly between the hips and swayed slightly but easily from side to side at each spring the knees alternately caught the weight without swerving and shifted it with an elastic toss from one to the other the feet came down sharp and firm and springily spurned the road in a rapid though rhythmical succession in a few moments the turn around the spur of the hill was reached and the runner was well settled down to his pace the stone fences the occasional apple trees the bushes and bits of rock bordering the road slipped by half seen the full use of the eyes was required for the path in front rough as it was with loose stones and seamed with irregular ruts easy work enough however as long as it remained level and open to the starlight but some distance beyond there dipped a pretty abrupt slope and here was need for care and quickness sometimes a step fell short or struck one side to avoid a stone or lengthened out to overpass it the whole body was thrown more back and the heels dug solidly into the earth at each downward leap here and there where the incline was steeper four or five foot tramps followed rapidly upon each other and then gathering himself up with a sudden strong clutch as it were the young man continued on as before thus the slope was left behind and now began a low long stretch lying between meadows overshadowed by a bordering of willow trees and studded with lengths of surreptitious puddles for the ground was clayey and the rain was unabsorbed as bressant entered upon it he felt the cold moisture of the air meet his warm face refreshingly he was breathing deep and regularly and now let himself out to a yet swifter pace than before the willow trees started suddenly from the forward darkness and vanished past in a dusky twinkling the road seemed drawn in swift smooth lines from beneath his feet he moving as in a mighty treadmill the breeze softly smote his forehead and whispered past his ears now he rose lightly in the air over an unexpected puddle striking the farther side with feet together and so on again twice or thrice his steps sounded hollowly over a plank bridging at a distance steadily approaching appeared the outlet light against the dark willow setting when it was
ve been a blacksmith in my day and lived in the ashes and dust yet it pleases me to think that when my dead bones are in the coffin white satin padding will come between them and the boards very sensible people do have such whims sometimes said clay apologetically wishing to be civil now you are not quite callous to outside impressions in an encouraging tone not quite or you would not be here laird told me how you studied medicine and tried journalism and finally left new york to be clerk in these out of the way iron works because here was your home the mountains had their hold on you i wanted to make money and i came here as the most likely place to make it laird told me you had saved some money and were anxious to double it soon with a quick side glance braddock had no secrets a trifle but my savings for three years about seven thousand dollars you ought to have put it into laird s hands it would have grown like weeds in a barn yard he is head of a ring in new york and philadelphia it s omnipotent sir it holds one city at least lawmakers and lawgivers so closing his large fingers on a dandelion seed on his palm yes if laird was a friend of yours your money would have yielded a thousand fold he was well enough disposed to me but i may have had a prejudice against planting my money in such dirty ground oh h with the same quick furtive glance well i have had just such a fancy in my time porter the pork dealer in new haven asked me once to go in with him a sure thing it was but i declined i may have stood over the forge said i but i ca nt see the name of julius ware going all over the country cut into greasy hams foolish but i have these idiosyncrasies ca nt cure myself of them any more than of my cleft chin braddock was silent they had run into another blind alley of conversation the only way out of which was that by which they had entered ware that never wearied subject sat tranquil combing his magnificent red beard with his white fingers and glancing alternately admiringly down on it and questioningly over the rolling hills as though inquiring whether nature knew who was coming oh by the way he said presently this friend of yours who was to have provided the trout andross has had some adventure they say missing eh yes too bad if there has been murder or that sort of thing but not likely we newspaper men know how such reports grow he ll turn up all right without the trout probably more s the pity come up tom said braddock with a queer tightening of his lips tom was carrying them lightly from the farm lands into the higher levels they had left judge maddox far behind the sun was bright a cool damp wind met them from the forests full of astringent piny smells ware heaved a sigh of luxury threw his cap down at his feet and stretching back clasped his hands behind his head he never could be still a moment he had been the best smith on the forge so far as thundering blows went now that he had neither hammer nor anvil and was cased in by broadcloth clothes and an education some restless force in his blood worked itself off in incessant motion of brain or body just now his brain having nothing bef ore it but andross he employed his body in what he would have called feeling of himself the mass of hair significant live hair he knew it to be the thick white prize fighter s throat the white stubby fingered hands he glanced critically and approvingly down at his brawny well shaped legs and then at braddock s all of whose members unfortunately had a lean and hungry look but appearing to remember lazily after awhile the subject of conversation do nt you think now braddock it was a little quixotic in you to bring this andross into the office with you to adopt christen him eh a middle aged poor devil with neither kith nor kin i hear no neither kith nor kin no friends but yourself and you pick him up charcoal burning and half starved and get him work shoulder him now i m one of the most impulsive of men but i never go into partnership with incompetency never you do nt know andross or you would not use the word i know with a triumphant laugh that he was a man of education burning charcoal at middle age when you saddled yourself with him depend on it if a man reaches thirty five without making his mark there s some part of the machine lacking i wonder what scrape the fellow has tumbled into now a woman eh i heard a hint of that at lock haven your information seems to have been minute ware oh no just a few words of gossip with the men on the platform while you swabbed tom s mouth i do nt confine myself to the brahmin caste for my friends i find companions among soldiers priests and pariahs besides the press touching himself lightly on his immaculately glossy white shirt absorbs information above ground as the long armed polypi draw in their dinners under water and it is about as hopeless an undertaking to fight one as to fight the other eh i suppose so t doctor braddock sat more stiffly erect while his com panion lolled back again feeling that he had by a lucky image put the relative position of press and public forcibly his imagery hair beard legs here was unfailing matter for contemplation with which he never wearied himself and oddly enough

sinister motive or unconsciously and in plain good faith in good faith i should say mr gryce remained silent for a moment it is very unfortunate you cannot explain yourself a little more definitely he said at last i am almost afraid to trust you to make investigations as you call them on your own hook you are not used to the business and will lose time to say nothing of running upon false scents and using up your strength on unprofitable details you should have thought of that when you admitted me into partnership and you absolutely insist upon working this mine alone mr gryce the matter stands just here mr clavering for all i know is a gentleman of untarnished reputation i am not even aware for what purpose you set me upon his trail i only know that in thus following it i have come upon certain facts that seem worthy of further investigation well well you know best but the days are slipping by something must be done and soon the public are becoming clamorous i know it and for that reason i have come to you for such assistance as you can give me at this stage of the proceedings you are in possession of certain facts relating to this man which it concerns me to know or your conduct in reference to him has been purposeless now frankly will you make me master of those facts in short tell me all you know of mr clavering without requiring an immediate return of confidence on my part that is asking a great deal of a professional detective i know it and under other circumstances i should hesitate long before preferring such a request but as things are i do nt see how i am to proceed in the matter without some such concession on your part at all events wait a moment is not mr clavering the lover of one of the young ladies anxious as i was to preserve the secret of my interest in that gentleman i could not prevent the blush from rising to my face at the suddenness of this question i thought as much he went on being neither a relative nor acknowledged friend i took it for granted he must occupy some such position as that in the family i do not see why you should draw such an inference said i anxious to determine how much he knew about him mr clavering is a stranger in town has not even been in this country long has indeed had no time to establish himself upon any such footing as you suggest this is not the only time mr clavering has been in new york he was here a year ago to my certain knowledge you know that yes how much more do you know can it be possible i am groping blindly about for facts which are already in your possession i pray you listen to my entreaties mr gryce and acquaint me at once with what i want to know you will not regret it i have no selfish motive in this matter if i succeed the glory shall be yours it i fail the shame of the defeat shall be mine that is fair he muttered and how about the reward my reward will be to free an innocent woman from the imputation of crime which hangs over her this assurance seemed to satisfy him his voice and appearance changed for a moment he looked quite confidential well well said he and what is it you want to know i should first like to know how your suspicions came to light on him at all what reason had you for thinking a gentleman of his bearing and position was in any way connected with this affair that is a question you ought not to be obliged to put he returned how so simply because the opportunity of answering it was in your hands before ever it came into mine what do you mean do nt you remember the letter mailed in your presence by miss mary leavenworth during your drive from her home to that of her friend in thirty seventh street on the afternoon of the inquest yes certainly but you never thought to look at its superscription before it was dropped into the box i had neither opportunity nor right to do so was it not written in your presence it was and you never regarded the affair as worth your attention however i may have regarded it i did not see how i could prevent miss leavenworth from dropping a letter into a box if she chose to do so that is because you are a gentleman well it has its disadvantages he muttered broodingly but you said i how came you to know anything about this letter ah i see remembering that the carriage in which we were riding at the time had been procured for us by him the man on the box was in your pay and informed as you call it mr gryce winked at his muffled toes mysteriously that is not the point he said enough that i heard that a letter which might reasonably prove to be of some interest to me had been dropped at such an hour into the box on the corner of a certain street that coinciding in the opinion of my informant i telegraphed to the station connected with that box to take note of the address of a suspicious looking letter about to pass through their hands on the way to the general post office and following up the telegram in person found that a curious epistle addressed in lead pencil and sealed with a stamp had just arrived the address of which i was allowed to see and which was henry r clavering hoffman house new york i drew a deep breath and so that is how your attention first came
see every thing on this plantation attached for debt myself included can it be possible yes it is mortgaged for every dollar it is worth oh heavens what silly creatures women are to be duped by such men but say nothing i will endeavor by stratagem to secure your freedom do you believe he left his orders in new york for furniture to be shipped rachel shook her head and said you do nt know the man i have made up my mind firmly to make my stay here but short has he anything he has a small plantation south of here which i believe is not mortgaged the overseer claims it in order to keep off his creditors it is said to be worth thirty or forty thousand dollars if such is the fact i shall try to revenge myself upon him when they returned home mr zevoe was there he had been absent nearly the entire day mrs zevoe approached him affectionately and kissed him he said dear jane i could not live without your presence i am happy to know that you love me and love me dearly replied mrs zevoe have you been taking a walk i called to see your white slave i am surprised at your thinking that she is white he continued the conversation by asking her what she thought of louisa mrs zevoe carelessly remarked i think she would make me a good waiting maid with her and rachel i think i could run this establishment and make myself contented i have one request to make of you what is it my dear i want you to make me out a bill of sale in my own name for louisa and rachel making them my own individual property mr zevoe laughed and said that is just what i intended doing louisa has three children has she not he seemed for a moment silent after recovering himself he replied she has who is the father of her children that is a matter i have not troubled myself to ascertain we are glad to have our property increase it pays good interest on the money in vested mrs zevoe smiled and said you will not think i am at all inquisitive it is a matter that interests me but little to morrow i will get lawyer wilson to draw up the papers he will be in the neighborhood and he promised to make me a call before returning accordingly the lawyer arrived the following morning mr zevoe was not in at the time the madam and him entered into conversation she informed him what she desired him to do lawyer wilson asked her if she had the consent of her husband and if he would sign the papers mrs zevoe said he would he then said it will be a capital thing for you i have been his attorney for years how does his business matters stand they are not in a healthy condition i shall advise him also to make over the lower plantation to you i hope you will i think you have influence enough with him to affect it during the conversation mr zevoe made his appearance and expressed himself highly gratified to see lawyer wilson after conversing a few moments he told the counsellor what he desired him to do in reference to rachel and louisa it is a wise act upon your part the lawyer asked him to step outside he wished to have a private conversation with him they walked out and had quite a consultation his attorney said your affairs are in a critical condition the mortgage on your property will be due in a few days i am satisfied you are not in a condition to meet it if so you had better give your wife a deed also of the lower plantation you are aware that my overseer mr lamar has a deed of that property i am satisfied he will cancel it if agreeable to you perfectly where is he he left here a short time since for havana on business he will not return for several days i will see him in the city and have a talk with him about it they then returned to the house and took the names of louisa and rachel and their ages the documents will be prepared day after to morrow you must sign them and i will have them recorded said lawyer wilson i shall be in town in a day or two and will call at your office after dining the lawyer bade them good day the following day he met mr lamar in the streets of havana and spoke to him on the subject he said he was perfectly willing to resign his claims to the plantation notwithstanding mr zevoe owed him some twelve hundred dollars yet he had confidence that mr zevoe would pay every dollar lawyer wilson took him to the recorder s office to cancel his claim with the understanding that mr zevoe would give him his note with an endorser for the amount the lawyer gave him his word that it would be done and made out the papers turning the estate together with louisa and her children and rachel over to mrs zevoe the second day following mr zevoe arrived in the city the documents were signed and recorded mr zevoe told lawyer wilson that his wife wished him to call out and see her in the course of a few days he said he would go and bring the documents with him owing to a pressure of business he was detained he wrote her a letter congratulating her on her success telling her he would call and see her as soon as an opportunity would afford she wrote a reply asking him to make out free papers for rachel and louisa and her children and to bring them when he came but not to divulge it to
chapter i for reasons which many persons thought ridiculous mrs lightfoot lee decided to pass the winter in washington she was in excellent health but she said that the climate would do her good in new york she had troops of friends but she suddenly became eager to see again the very small number of those who lived on the potomac it was only to her closest intimates that she honestly acknowledged herself to be tortured by ennui since her husband s death five years before she had lost her taste for new york society she had felt no interest in the price of stocks and very little in the men who dealt in them she had become serious what was it all worth this wilderness of men and women as monotonous as the brown stone houses they lived in in her despair she had resorted to desperate measures she had read philosophy in the original german and the more she read the more she was disheartened that so much culture should lead to nothing nothing after talking of herbert spencer for an entire evening with a very literary transcendental commission merchant she could not see that her time had been better employed than when in former days she had passed it in flirting with a very agreeable young stock broker indeed there was an evident proof to the contrary for the flirtation might lead to something had in fact led to marriage while the philosophy could lead to nothing unless it were perhaps to another evening of the same kind because transcendental philosophers are mostly elderly men usually married and when engaged in business somewhat apt to be sleepy towards evening nevertheless mrs lee did her best to turn her study to practical use she plunged into philanthropy visited prisons inspected hospitals read the literature of pauperism and crime saturated herself with the statistics of vice until her mind had nearly lost sight of virtue at last it rose in rebellion against her and she came to the limit of her strength this path too seemed to lead nowhere she declared that she had lost the sense of duty and that so far as concerned her all the paupers and criminals in new york might henceforward rise in their majesty and manage every railway on the continent why should she care what was the city to her she could find nothing in it that seemed to demand salvation what gave peculiar sanctity to numbers why were a million people who all resembled each other any way more interesting than one person what aspiration could she help to put into the mind of this great million armed monster that would make it worth her love or respect religion a thousand powerful churches were doing their best and she could see no chance for a new faith of which she was to be the inspired prophet ambition high popular ideals passion for whatever is lofty and pure the very words irritated her was she not herself devoured by ambition and was she not now eating her heart out because she could find no one object worth a sacrifice was it ambition real ambition or was it mere restlessness that made mrs lightfoot lee so bitter against new york and philadelphia baltimore and boston american life in general and all life in particular what did she want not social position for she herself was an eminently respectable philadelphian by birth her father a famous clergyman and her husband had been equally irreproachable a descendant of one branch of the virginia lees which had drifted to new york in search of fortune and had found it or enough of it to keep the young man there his widow had her own place in society which no one disputed though not brighter than her neighbours the world persisted in classing her among clever women she had wealth or at least enough of it to give her all that money can give by way of pleasure to a sensible woman in an american city she had her house and her carriage she dressed well her table was good and her furniture was never allowed to fall behind the latest standard of decorative art she had travelled in europe and after several visits covering some years of time had returned home carrying in one hand as it were a green grey landscape a remarkably pleasing specimen of corot and in the other some bales of persian and syrian rugs and embroideries japanese bronzes and porcelain with this she declared europe to be exhausted and she frankly avowed that she was american to the tips of her fingers she neither knew nor greatly cared whether america or europe were best to live in she had no violent love for either and she had no objection to abusing both but she meant to get all that american life had to offer good or bad and to drink it down to the dregs fully determined that whatever there was in it she would have and that whatever could be made out of it she would manufacture i know said she that america produces petroleum and pigs i have seen both on the steamers and i am told it produces silver and gold there is choice enough for any woman yet as has been already said mrs lee s first experience was not a success she soon declared that new york might represent the petroleum or the pigs but the gold of life was not to be discovered there by her eyes not but that there was variety enough a variety of people occupations aims and thoughts but that all these after growing to a certain height stopped short they found nothing to hold them up she knew more or less intimately a dozen men whose fortunes ranged between one million and forty millions what did they do with their money what could they do with it that was different
you do nt know half how good a place guilford is mr stubbs the monkey chattered away as if he were anticipating lots of fun on his arrival at toby s home and the boy chattered back his spirits rising at every step which took him farther away from the collection of tents where he had spent so many wretched hours a brisk walk of half an hour sufficed to take toby to the woods and after some little search he found a thick clump of bushes in which he concluded he could sleep without the risk of being seen by anyone who might pass that way before he should be awake in the morning he had not much choice in the way of a bed for it was so dark in the woods that it was impossible to collect moss or leaves to make a soft resting place and the few leaves and pine boughs which he did gather made his place for sleeping but very little softer but during the ten weeks that toby had been with the circus his bed had seldom been anything softer than the seat of the wagon and it troubled him very little that he was to sleep with nothing but a few leaves between himself and the earth using the bundle in which was his riding costume for a pillow and placing the lunch mrs treat had given him near by where the monkey could not get at it conveniently he cuddled mr stubbs up to his bosom and lay down to sleep mr lord wo nt wake us up in the mornin an swear at us for not washin the tumblers said toby in a tone of satisfaction to the monkey an we wo nt have to go into the tent tomorrow an sell sick lemonade an poor peanuts but and here his tone changed to one of sorrow there ll be some there that ll be sorry not to see us in the mornin mr stubbs though they ll be glad to know that we got away all right but wo nt mr lord swear an wo nt mr castle crack his whip when they come to look round for us in the mornin an find that we hai nt there the reply which the monkey made to this was to nestle his head closer under toby s coat and to show in the most decided manner that he was ready to go to sleep and toby was quite as ready to go to sleep as he was he had worked hard that day but the excitement of escaping had prevented him from realizing his fatigue until after he had lain down and almost before he had got through congratulating himself upon the ease with which he had gotten free both he and the monkey were as sound asleep as if they had been tucked up in the softest bed that was ever made toby s very weariness was a friend to him that night for it prevented him from waking which if he had done so might have been unpleasant when he fully realized that he was all alone in the forest and the sounds that are always heard in the woods might have frightened him just the least bit the sun was shining directly in his face when toby awoke on the following morning and the old monkey was still snugly nestled under his coat he sat up rather dazed at first and then as he fully realized that he was actually free from all that had made his life such a sad and hard one for so many weeks he shouted aloud reveling in his freedom the monkey awakened by toby s cries started from his sleep in affright and jumped into the nearest tree only to chatter jump and swing from the boughs when he saw that there was nothing very unusual going on save that he and toby were out in the woods again where they could have no end of a good time and do just as they liked after a few moments spent in a short jubilee at their escape toby took the monkey on his shoulder and the bundles under his arm again and went cautiously out to the edge of the thicket where he could form some idea as to whether or no they were pursued he had entered the woods at the brow of a small hill when he had fled so hastily on the previous evening and looking down he could see the spot whereon the tents of the circus had been pitched but not a sign of them was now visible he could see a number of people walking around and he fancied that they looked up every now and then to where he stood concealed by the foliage this gave him no little uneasiness for he feared that mr lord or mr castle might be among the number and he believed that they would begin a search for him at once and that the spot where their attention would first be drawn was exactly where he was then standing this wo nt do mr stubbs he said as he pushed the monkey higher up on his shoulder and started into the thickest part of the woods we must get out of this place an go farther down where we can hide till tomorrow mornin besides we must find some water where we can wash our faces the old monkey would hardly have been troubled if they had not got their faces washed for the next month to come but he grinned and talked as toby trudged along attempting to catch hold of the leaves as they were passed and in various other ways impeding his master s progress until toby was obliged to give him a most severe scolding in order to make him behave himself in anything like a decent manner at last after fully half

said olly you ll let us take spot she can go in my box now spot was the white kitten so milly and mother began to laugh suppose you go and ask spot first whether she d like it olly said mrs norton patting his sunburnt little face chapter ii a journey north milly and oliver lived at willingham a little town in oxfordshire as i have already told you their father was a doctor and they lived in an old fashioned house in a street with a long shady garden stretching away behind it milly and oliver loved their father and whenever he put his brown face inside the nursery door two pairs of little feet went running to meet him and two pairs of little hands pulled him eagerly into the room but they saw him very seldom whereas their mother was always with them teaching them their lessons playing with them in the garden telling them stories mending their frocks tucking them up in their snug little beds at night sometimes praising them sometimes scolding them always loving and looking after them milly and olly honestly believed that theirs was the best mother in the whole world nobody else could find out such nice plays or tell them such wonderful stories or dress dolls half so well two little neighbours of theirs jacky and francis had a poor sick mother who always lay on the sofa and could hardly bear to have her little boys in the room with her milly and oliver were never tired of wondering how jacky and francis got on with a mother like that how funny and how dreadful it must be poor jacky and francis it never came into their heads to say poor jacky s mother too but then you see they were such little people and little people have only room in their heads for a very few thoughts at a time however milly had been away from her mother a good deal lately about six months before my story begins she had been sent to school to a kindergarten as she was taught to call it and there milly had learnt all kinds of wonderful things she had learnt how to make mats out of paper blue mats and pink mats and yellow mats and red mats she had learned how to make a bit of soft clay look like a box or a stool or a bird s nest with three clay eggs inside it she had begun to add up and take away and above all she had begun to learn geography and frulein for milly s mistress was a german and had a german name was just now teaching her about islands and lakes and capes and peninsulas and many other things that all little girls have to learn about some time or other unless they wish to grow up dunces as for milly s looks i have told you already that she had blue eyes and a turn up nose and a dear sensible little face and she had very thick fair hair that was always tumbling about her eyes and making her look as nurse told her like a yellow owl in an ivy bush milly loved most people except perhaps john the gardener who was rather cross to the children and was always calling to them not to walk on them beds and to be sure not to touch any of his fruit or flowers she loved her father and her mother she loved olly with all her whole heart though he was a tease she loved her nurse whom she and olly called nana and who had been with them ever since milly was born and she loved frulein and was always begging flowers from her mother that she might take them to school for frulein s table so you see milly was made up of loving and she was a thoughtful little girl too tidy with her dress quick and quiet at her lessons and always ready to sit still with her fairy book or her doll when mother was busy or tired but there were two things in which milly was not at all sensible in spite of her sensible face she was much too ready to cry when any little thing went wrong and she was dreadfully afraid of creatures of all sorts she was afraid of her father s big dog she was afraid of the dear brown cow that lived in the field beyond the garden she was afraid of earwigs i am even ashamed to say she was afraid of spiders once she ran away as if a lion were behind her from a white kitten that pulled her dress with its frolicsome paws to make her play with it but that milly would tell you was when i was little and she was quite sure she was a good deal braver now now what am i to tell you about olly olly was just a round ball of fun and mischief he had brown hair brown eyes a brown face and brown hands he was always touching and meddling with everything indoors and out to see what was inside it or what it was made of he liked teasing milly he liked his walks he liked his sleep in the morning he liked his dinner he liked his tea he liked everything in the world except learning to read and that he hated he could only do one thing besides mischief he could sing all kinds of tunes quick tunes slow tunes and merry tunes he had been able to sing tunes ever since he was quite a tiny baby and his father and mother often talked together of how in about a year he should be taught to play on the piano or perhaps on the violin if he liked it better you might hear his sharp shrill little voice singing about the
from a vile pestiferous slough i think it most probable though of course it s only an opinion that you ll all have the deuce to pay before you get that malaria out of your systems camp in a bog would you silver i m surprised at you you re less of a fool than many take you all round but you do nt appear to me to have the rudiments of a notion of the rules of health well he added after he had dosed them round and they had taken his prescriptions with really laughable humility more like charity schoolchildren than blood guilty mutineers and pirates well that s done for today and now i should wish to have a talk with that boy please and he nodded his head in my direction carelessly george merry was at the door spitting and spluttering over some bad tasted medicine but at the first word of the doctor s proposal he swung round with a deep flush and cried no and swore silver struck the barrel with his open hand si lence he roared and looked about him positively like a lion doctor he went on in his usual tones i was a thinking of that knowing as how you had a fancy for the boy we re all humbly grateful for your kindness and as you see puts faith in you and takes the drugs down like that much grog and i take it i ve found a way as ll suit all hawkins will you give me your word of honour as a young gentleman for a young gentleman you are although poor born your word of honour not to slip your cable i readily gave the pledge required then doctor said silver you just step outside o that stockade and once you re there i ll bring the boy down on the inside and i reckon you can yarn through the spars good day to you sir and all our dooties to the squire and cap n smollett the explosion of disapproval which nothing but silver s black looks had restrained broke out immediately the doctor had left the house silver was roundly accused of playing double of trying to make a separate peace for himself of sacrificing the interests of his accomplices and victims and in one word of the identical exact thing that he was doing it seemed to me so obvious in this case that i could not imagine how he was to turn their anger but he was twice the man the rest were and his last night s victory had given him a huge preponderance on their minds he called them all the fools and dolts you can imagine said it was necessary i should talk to the doctor fluttered the chart in their faces asked them if they could afford to break the treaty the very day they were bound a treasure hunting no by thunder he cried it s us must break the treaty when the time comes and till then i ll gammon that doctor if i have to ile his boots with brandy and then he bade them get the fire lit and stalked out upon his crutch with his hand on my shoulder leaving them in a disarray and silenced by his volubility rather than convinced slow lad slow he said they might round upon us in a twinkle of an eye if we was seen to hurry very deliberately then did we advance across the sand to where the doctor awaited us on the other side of the stockade and as soon as we were within easy speaking distance silver stopped you ll make a note of this here also doctor says he and the boy ll tell you how i saved his life and were deposed for it too and you may lay to that doctor when a man s steering as near the wind as me playing chuck farthing with the last breath in his body like you would nt think it too much mayhap to give him one good word you ll please bear in mind it s not my life only now it s that boy s into the bargain and you ll speak me fair doctor and give me a bit o hope to go on for the sake of mercy silver was a changed man once he was out there and had his back to his friends and the block house his cheeks seemed to have fallen in his voice trembled never was a soul more dead in earnest why john you re not afraid asked dr livesey doctor i m no coward no not i not so much and he snapped his fingers if i was i would nt say it but i ll own up fairly i ve the shakes upon me for the gallows you re a good man and a true i never seen a better man and you ll not forget what i done good not any more than you ll forget the bad i know and i step aside see here and leave you and jim alone and you ll put that down for me too for it s a long stretch is that so saying he stepped back a little way till he was out of earshot and there sat down upon a tree stump and began to whistle spinning round now and again upon his seat so as to command a sight sometimes of me and the doctor and sometimes of his unruly ruffians as they went to and fro in the sand between the fire which they were busy rekindling and the house from which they brought forth pork and bread to make the breakfast so jim said the doctor sadly here you are as you have brewed so shall you drink my boy heaven knows i cannot find it in my heart to blame you but this much i will
out her hands before her like one groping his way what what is it she looked from atherton s face to her father s the old man stopped and tried to smile reassuringly he tried to speak atherton turned away it was halleck who came forward and took her wandering hands he held them quivering in his own and said gravely and steadily using her name for the first time in the deep pity which cast out all fear and shame marcia we have found your husband dead she made with her lips he is alive said halleck there is something in this paper for you to see something you must see i can bear anything if he is not dead where what is it show it to me the paper shook in the hands which halleck released her eyes strayed blindly over its columns he had to put his finger on the place before she could find it then her tremor ceased and she seemed without breath or pulse while she read it through she fetched a long deep sigh and passed her hand over her eyes as if to clear them staying herself unconsciously against halleck s breast and laying her trembling arm along his arm till her fingers knit themselves among his fingers she read it a second time and a third then she dropped the paper and turned to look up at him why she cried as if she had made it out at last while an awful joyful light of hope flashed into her face it is a mistake do nt you see he thinks that i never came back he thinks that i meant to abandon him that i that i but you know that i came back you came back with me why i was nt gone an hour a half hour hardly oh bartley poor bartley he thought i could leave him and take his child from him that i could be so wicked so heartless oh no no no why i only stayed away that little time because i was afraid to go back do nt you remember how i told you i was afraid and wanted you to come in with me her exaltation broke in a laugh but we can explain it now and it will be all right he will see he will understand i will tell him just how it was oh flavia flavia we ve found papa we ve found papa quick she whirled away toward the stairs but her father caught her by the arm marcia he shouted in his old raucous voice you ve got to understand this he hesitated as if running over all terms of opprobrium in his mind and he resumed as if he had found them each too feeble bartley has nt acted under any mistake he set the facts before her with merciless clearness and she listened with an audible catching of the breath at times while she softly smoothed her forehead with her left hand i do nt believe it she said when he had ended write to him tell him what i say and you will see the old man uttered something between a groan and a curse oh you poor crazy child can nothing make you understand that bartley wants to get rid of you and that he s just as ready for one lie as another he thinks he can make out a case of abandonment with the least trouble and so he accuses you of that but he d just as soon accuse you of anything else write to him you ve got to go to him you ve got to go out there and fight him in open court with facts and witnesses do you suppose bartley hubbard wants any explanation from you do you think he s been waiting these two years to hear that you did nt really abandon him but came back to this house an hour after you left it and that you ve waited for him here ever since when he knows that will he withdraw this suit of his and come home he ll want the proof and the way to do is to go out there and let him have it if i had him on the stand for five minutes said the old man between his set teeth just five minutes i d undertake to convince him from his own lips that he was wrong about you but i am afraid he would nt mind a letter you think i say so because i hate him and you do nt believe me well ask either of these gentlemen here whether i m telling you the truth she did not speak but with a glance at their averted faces she sank into a chair and passed one hand over the other while she drew her breath in long shuddering respirations and stared at the floor with knit brows and starting eyes like one stifling a deadly pang she made several attempts to speak before she could utter any sound then she lifted her eyes to her father s let us let us go home oh let us go home i will give him up i had given him up already i told you she said turning to halleck and speaking in a slow gentle tone only an hour ago that he was dead and this this that s happened it makes no difference why did you bring the paper to me when you knew that i thought he was dead god knows i wished to keep it from you well no matter now let him go free if he wants to i ca nt help it you can help it interrupted her father you ve got the facts on your side and you ve got the witnesses would you go out with me and tell him that i never meant to leave him she asked simply
as you please only never forget that i pointed out to you the right course in time thank you ram lal for your friendly concern in my behalf i do not think i shall act as you suggest but i am nevertheless grateful to you there is one thing i want to ask you and consult you about however my friend what is the use of my giving you advice that you will not follow if i lived with you and were your constant companion you would ask me to advise you twenty times a day and then you would go and do the diametric opposite of what i suggested if i did not see in you something that i see in few other men i would not be here there are plenty of fools who have wit enough to take counsel of a wise man there are few men of wit wise enough to be guided by their betters as if they were only fools for the time yet because you are so wayward i will help you once or twice more and then i will leave you to your own course which you in your blindness will call your kismet not seeing that your fate is continually in your own hands more so at this moment than ever before ask and i will answer thanks ram lal it is this i would know you are aware that i have undertaken a novel kind of bargain the man you wot of is to be delivered to me near keitung i am anxious for the man s safety afterwards and i would be glad of some hint about disposing of him i must go alone for i do not want any witness of what i am going to do and as a mere matter of personal safety for myself and the man i am going to set free i must decide on some plan of action when i meet the band of sowars who will escort him they are capable of murdering us both if the maharajah instructs them to as long as i am alive to bring the old man into disgrace with the british the captive is safe but it would be an easy matter for those fellows to dispose of us together and there would be an end of the business of course they could replied ram lal adding in an ironical tone and if you insist upon putting your head down the tiger s throat how do you expect me to prevent the brute from snapping it off that would be a phenomenon would it not and only this evening you were saying that you despised phenomena i said that such things were indifferent to me i did not say i despised them but i think that this thing may be done without performing any miracles if it were not such a good action on your part i would have nothing to do with it but since you mean to risk your neck for your own peculiar views of what is right i will endeavour that you shall not break it i will meet you a day s journey before you reach keitung somewhere on the road and we will go together and do the business but if i am to help you i will not promise not to perform some miracles as you call them though you know very well they are no such thing meanwhile do as you please about the tiger hunt i shall say no more about it he paused and then withdrawing one delicate hand from the folds of his caftn he pointed to the wall behind isaacs and me and said what a very singular piece of workmanship is that yataghan we both naturally turned half round to look at the weapon he spoke of which was the central piece in a trophy of jewelled sabres and afghan knives yes said isaacs turning back to answer his guest it is a he stopped and i who had not seen the weapon before lost among so many and was admiring its singular beauty turned too to my astonishment i saw that isaacs was gazing into empty space the divan where ram lal had been sitting an instant before was vacant he was gone that is rather sudden i said more so than usual was the reply did you see him go did he go out by the door not i i answered when i looked round at the wall he was placidly sitting on that divan pointing with one hand at the yataghan does he generally go so quickly yes more or less now i will show you some pretty sport he rose to his feet and went to the door narain he cried narain the bearer who was squatting against the door post outside sprang up and stood before his master narain why did you not show that pundit the way downstairs what do you mean have you no manners narain stood open mouthed what pundit sahib he asked why the pundit who came a quarter of an hour ago you donkey he has just gone out and you did not even get up and make a salaam you impertinent vagabond narain protested that no pundit or sahib or any one else had passed the threshold since ram lal had entered ha you budmash you lazy dog of a hindoo you have been asleep again you swine you son of a pig you father of piglings is that the way you do your work in my service isaacs was enjoying the joke in a quiet way immensely sahib said the trembling narain apparently forgetting the genealogy his master had thrust upon him sahib you are protector of the poor you are my father and my mother and my brother and all my relations the common form of hindoo supplication but sri krishnaji by the blessed krishna i have not slept
arrange the quarrel but the stillness remained unbroken save by the sea gulls and the surf i had a weight at my heart when we desisted and i saw that even northmour was unusually pale he looked over his shoulder nervously as though he feared that some one had crept between him and the pavilion door by god he said in a whisper this is too much for me i replied in the same key suppose there should be none after all look there he returned nodding with his head as though he had been afraid to point i glanced in the direction indicated and there from the northern quarter of the sea wood beheld a thin column of smoke rising steadily against the now cloudless sky northmour i said we still continued to talk in whispers it is not possible to endure this suspense i prefer death fifty times over stay you here to watch the pavilion i will go forward and make sure if i have to walk right into their camp he looked once again all round him with puckered eyes and then nodded assentingly to my proposal my heart beat like a sledge hammer as i set out walking rapidly in the direction of the smoke and though up to that moment i had felt chill and shivering i was suddenly conscious of a glow of heat over all my body the ground in this direction was very uneven a hundred men might have lain hidden in as many square yards about my path but i had not practised the business in vain chose such routes as cut at the very root of concealment and by keeping along the most convenient ridges commanded several hollows at a time it was not long before i was rewarded for my caution coming suddenly on to a mound somewhat more elevated than the surrounding hummocks i saw not thirty yards away a man bent almost double and running as fast as his attitude permitted along the bottom of a gully i had dislodged one of the spies from his ambush as soon as i sighted him i called loudly both in english and italian and he seeing concealment was no longer possible straightened himself out leaped from the gully and made off as straight as an arrow for the borders of the wood it was none of my business to pursue i had learned what i wanted that we were beleaguered and watched in the pavilion and i returned at once and walking as nearly as possible in my old footsteps to where northmour awaited me beside the despatch box he was even paler than when i had left him and his voice shook a little could you see what he was like he asked he kept his back turned i replied let us get into the house frank i do nt think i m a coward but i can stand no more of this he whispered all was still and sunshiny about the pavilion as we turned to re enter it even the gulls had flown in a wider circuit and were seen flickering along the beach and sand hills and this loneliness terrified me more than a regiment under arms it was not until the door was barricaded that i could draw a full inspiration and relieve the weight that lay upon my bosom northmour and i exchanged a steady glance and i suppose each made his own reflections on the white and startled aspect of the other you were right i said all is over shake hands old man for the last time yes replied he i will shake hands for as sure as i am here i bear no malice but remember if by some impossible accident we should give the slip to these blackguards i ll take the upper hand of you by fair or foul oh said i you weary me he seemed hurt and walked away in silence to the foot of the stairs where he paused you do not understand said he i am not a swindler and i guard myself that is all it may weary you or not mr cassilis i do not care a rush i speak for my own satisfaction and not for your amusement you had better go upstairs and court the girl for my part i stay here and i stay with you i returned do you think i would steal a march even with your permission frank he said smiling it s a pity you are an ass for you have the makings of a man i think i must be fey to day you cannot irritate me even when you try do you know he continued softly i think we are the two most miserable men in england you and i we have got on to thirty without wife or child or so much as a shop to look after poor pitiful lost devils both and now we clash about a girl as if there were not several millions in the united kingdom ah frank frank the one who loses this throw be it you or me he has my pity it were better for him how does the bible say that a millstone were hanged about his neck and he were cast into the depth of the sea let us take a drink he concluded suddenly but without any levity of tone i was touched by his words and consented he sat down on the table in the dining room and held up the glass of sherry to his eye if you beat me frank he said i shall take to drink what will you do if it goes the other way god knows i returned well said he here is a toast in the meantime italia irredenta the remainder of the day was passed in the same dreadful tedium and suspense i laid the table for dinner while northmour and clara
said but come let us go to her at once they found her still sleeping but not profoundly her face was unnaturally flushed and wore a troubled expression while her breathing seemed labored as they stood anxiously regarding her she woke with a sharp cry of distress and anguish then catching sight of her husband bending over her her face grew radiant and throwing her arms about his neck o ned dear ned she cried are you here and do you love me yet dearly dearly my darling he said holding her close what has troubled you oh such a dreadful dream i thought i was all alone in a desert and could nt find you anywhere but drames always go by conthraries my dear he quoted sportively then more seriously are you quite well love he asked a little dull and a trifle headachy she answered smiling up at him but i think a cup of coffee and a drive with my husband in the sweet morning air will cure me you shall have both with the least possible delay what time is it have you been to breakfast it s about nine and i have taken breakfast i think you must have some before exerting yourself to dress just as you say it s nice to have you tell me what to do she said nestling closer in his arms i ca nt think why i should ever have disliked it i presume it was all the fault of my tone and manner sometimes of my words too he said passing his hand caressingly over her hair and cheek i m afraid i ve been decidedly bearish on several occasions but i trust i shall have the grace to treat my wife with politeness and consideration after this elsie who had left the room on zoe s awaking now came in and bidding her an affectionate good morning said she had ordered her breakfast to be brought up at once adding i hope you will do it justice my dear i ll see that she does mamma edward answered for her in sportive tone she has made such fair promises of submission obedience and all that that she ll hardly dare refuse to do anything i bid her i have nt been very good about it lately mamma zoe said looking half tearfully half smilingly from one to the other but ned s forgiven me and now i feel as you say you did that it s a real pleasure to give up my wishes to one i love so very dearly and who is i know very much wiser than i that is right dear elsie said tenderly and i trust he will show himself worthy of all your love and confidence the two now comported themselves like a pair of lovers as indeed they had done through all their brief married life except the last few days edward exerted himself for the entertainment of his little wife during their drive and was very tender and careful of her on their return he bade her lie down on the sofa in her boudoir and rest averring that she looked languid and unlike herself to please you she said obeying the mandate with a smiling glance up into his face that s a good child he responded sitting down beside her and smoothing her hair with fond caressing hand now what shall i do to please you stay here close beside me and hold my hand and talk to me very well he answered closing his fingers over the hand she put into his then lifting it to his lips how your face has changed love since that frightened look you gave me when i came in with the lamp last night how frightened and ashamed i was ned she exclaimed tears springing to her eyes i felt that you had a right to beat me if you wanted to and i should nt have said a word if you d done it but you could nt have feared that he said with a pained look and coloring deeply no oh no indeed i know you would never do that but i dreaded what you might say and did not at all expect you would be so kind and forgiving and loving to me but how was i brought up here i knew nothing from the instant you were at my side on the door step till i saw you coming in with the lamp in your husband s arms what a heavy load for you to carry she said looking at him with concern no not at all i did it with perfect ease except for the darkness and the fear that you might recover consciousness on the way and scream out with affright before you discovered who your captor was my husband my dear kind husband she murmured softly stroking his face as he bent over her to press a kiss upon her forehead my darling little wife he returned then after a moment s silent exchange of caresses would you mind telling me where you were going and what you intended to do he asked with a half smile i have no right to refuse if you require a full confession she said half playfully half tearfully and blushing deeply i do nt require it but should like to have it nevertheless for i confess my curiosity is piqued he said with an amused yet tender look and tone there is nt really very much to tell she sighed only that because i was dreadfully unhappy and had worked myself up to believing that i was a hated wife a burden and annoyance to my husband i thought it would be an act of noble self sacrifice to run away and o ned please do nt laugh at me i am not laughing love he said in soothing half tremulous tones taking her in his
maud she lifted a bright glance through her tears and said like a happy child to whom a new game has been proposed what shall we try simple as the words were both of them seemed to feel that a certain relation a certain responsibility had been established between them the thought exhilarated maud it seemed the beginning of her long expected romance while the glow of kind feeling about the heart of farnham could not keep him from suspecting that he was taking a very imprudent step but they sat a good while discussing various plans for maud s advantage and arriving at nothing definite for her own ideas were based upon a dime novel theory of the world and farnham at last concluded that he would be forced finally to choose some way of life for his protegee and then persuade her to accept it he grew silent and thoughtful with this reflection and the conversation languished he was trying to think how he could help her without these continued interviews at his house when she disposed of the difficulty by rising briskly and saying well i will call again in a day or two about this hour yes if it suits you best he answered with a troubled brow he followed her to the door as she went out she said may i pick a flower as i go he seized his hat and said come with me to the rose house in the garden and you shall have something better they walked together down the gravel paths through the neat and well kept garden where the warm spring sunshine was calling life out of the tender turf and the air was full of delicate odors she seemed as gay and happy as a child on a holiday her disappointment of an hour ago was all gone in the feeling that arthur was interested in her was caring for her future without any definite hopes or dreams she felt as if the world was suddenly grown richer and wider something good was coming to her certainly something good had come for was she not walking in this lovely garden with its handsome proprietor who was she even began to think her friend the turf was as soft the air as mild the sun as bright as in any of her romances and the figure of farnham s wealth which she had heard from her father rang musically in her mind they went into the rose house and he gave her two or three splendid satiny marechal niels and then a jacqueminot so big so rich and lustrous in its dark beauty that she could not help crying out with delight he was pleased with her joy and gave her another for your hair he said she colored with pleasure till her cheek was like the royal flower hallo thought farnham to himself she does not take these things as a matter of course when they came into the garden again he made the suggestion which had been in his mind for the last half hour if you are going home the nearest way will be by the garden gate into bishop s lane it is only a minute from there to dean street why that would be perfectly lovely but where is the gate i will show you they walked together to the lower end of the lawn where a long line of glass houses built against the high wall which separated the garden from the street called bishop s lane sheltered the grapes and the pine apples at the end of this conservatory in the wall was a little door of thin but strong steel plates concealed from sight by a row of pear trees farnham opened it and said if you like you can come in by this way it is never locked in the daytime it will save you a long walk thanks she replied that will be perfectly lovely her resources of expression were not copious but her eyes and her mouth spoke volumes of joy and gratitude her hands were full of roses and as she raised her beautiful face to him with pleasure flashing from her warm cheeks and lips and eyes she seemed to exhale something of the vigorous life and impulse of the spring sunshine farnham felt that he had nothing to do but stoop and kiss the blooming flower like face and in her exalted condition she would have thought little more of it than a blush rose thinks of the same treatment but he refrained and said good morning because she seemed in no mood to say it first good by for a day or two she said gayly as she bent her head to pass under the low lintel of the gate farnham walked back to the house not at all satisfied with himself i wonder whether i have mended matters she is certainly too pretty a girl to be running in and out of my front door in the sight of all the avenue how much better will it be for her to use the private entrance and come and go by a sort of stealth but then she does not regard it that way she is so ignorant of this wicked world that it seems to her merely a saving of ten minutes walk around the block well all there is of it i must find a place for her before she domesticates herself here the thought of what should be done with her remained persistently with him and kept him irritated by the vision of her provoking and useless beauty if she were a princess he thought all the poets would be twanging their lyres about her all the artists would be dying to paint her she would have songs made to her and sacred oratorios given under her patronage she would preside at church fairs and open the dance at charity balls
the principles of life all right do nt you yes i do replied the other taking his turn at folding arms h m m i dare say you do what you lack is the practice the doctor sealed his utterance with a nod the young man showed amusement more it may be than he felt and presently pointed out his lodging place here on this side number and they alighted chapter iii his wife in former times the presence in new orleans during the cooler half of the year of large numbers of mercantile men from all parts of the world who did not accept the fever plagued city as their permanent residence made much business for the renters of furnished apartments at the same time there was a class of persons whose residence was permanent and to whom this letting of rooms fell by an easy and natural gravitation and the most respectable and comfortable rented rooms of which the city could boast were those chambres garnies in custom house and bienville streets kept by worthy free or freed mulatto or quadroon women in the gala days of this half caste people were quite over difference was made between virtue and vice and the famous quadroon balls were shunned by those who aspired to respectability whether their whiteness was nature or only toilet powder generations of domestic service under ladies of gallic blood had brought many of them to a supreme pitch of excellence as housekeepers in many cases money had been inherited in other cases it had been saved up that latin feminine ability to hold an awkward position with impregnable serenity and like the yellow mississippi to give back no reflection from the overhanging sky emphasized this superior fitness that bright womanly business ability that comes of the same blood added again to their excellence not to be home itself nothing could be more like it than were the apartments let by madame cecile or madame sophie or madame athalie or madame polyxne or whatever the name might be it was in one of these houses that presented its dull brick front directly upon the sidewalk of custom house street with the unfailing little square sign of chambres louer rooms to let dangling by a string from the overhanging balcony and twirling in the breeze that the sick wife lay a waiting slave girl opened the door as the two men approached it and both of them went directly upstairs and into a large airy room on a high finely carved and heavily hung mahogany bed to which the remaining furniture corresponded in ancient style and massiveness was stretched the form of a pale sweet faced little woman the proprietress of the house was sitting beside the bed a quadroon of good kind face forty five years old or so tall and broad she rose and responded to the doctor s silent bow with that pretty dignity of greeting which goes with all french blood and remained standing the invalid stirred the physician came forward to the bedside the patient could not have been much over nineteen years of age her face was very pleasing a trifle slender in outline the brows somewhat square not wide the mouth small she would not have been called beautiful even in health by those who lay stress on correctness of outlines but she had one thing that to some is better whether it was in the dark blue eyes that were lifted to the doctor s with a look which changed rapidly from inquiry to confidence or in the fine scarcely perceptible strands of pale brown hair that played about her temples he did not make out but for one cause or another her face was of that kind which almost any one has seen once or twice and no one has seen often that seems to give out a soft but veritable light she was very weak her eyes quickly dropped away from his and turned wearily but peacefully to those of her husband the doctor spoke to her his greeting and gentle inquiry were full of a soothing quality that was new to the young man his long fingers moved twice or thrice softly across her brow pushing back the thin waving strands and then he sat down in a chair continuing his kind direct questions the answers were all bad he turned his glance to the quadroon she understood it the patient was seriously ill the nurse responded with a quiet look of comprehension at the same time the doctor disguised from the young strangers this interchange of meanings by an audible question to the quadroon have i ever met you before no seh what is your name zenobie madame zenobie softly whispered the invalid turning her eyes with a glimmer of feeble pleasantry first to the quadroon and then to her husband the physician smiled at her an instant and then gave a few concise directions to the quadroon get me thus and so the woman went and came she was a superior nurse like so many of her race so obvious indeed was this that when she gently pressed the young husband an inch or two aside and murmured that de doctah wanted him to go h out he left the room although he knew the physician had not so indicated by and by he returned but only at her beckon and remained at the bedside while madame zenobie led the doctor into another room to write his prescription who are these people asked the physician in an undertone looking up at the quadroon and pausing with the prescription half torn off she shrugged her large shoulders and smiled perplexedly mizzez reechin the tone was one of query rather than assertion dey sesso she added she might nurse the lady like a mother but she was not going to be responsible for the genuineness of a stranger s name where are they from i dunno
of the room and she was lying on the outside dressed in a wonderful dressing gown that looked like a fleecy cloud her golden hair fell in fluffy curls over her white forehead and neck her cheeks flushed delicately her eyes beamed with joy and the children told their mother afterwards that she looked as beautiful as the angels in the picture books there was a great bustle behind a huge screen in another part of the room and at half past five this was taken away and the christmas dinner table stood revealed what a wonderful sight it was to the poor little ruggles children who ate their sometimes scanty meals on the kitchen table it blazed with tall colored candles it gleamed with glass and silver it blushed with flowers it groaned with good things to eat so it was not strange that the ruggleses forgetting altogether that their mother was a mcgrill shrieked in admiration of the fairy spectacle but larry s behavior was the most disgraceful for he stood not upon the order of his going but went at once for a high chair that pointed unmistakably to him climbed up like a squirrel gave a comprehensive look at the turkey clapped his hands in ecstasy rested his fat arms on the table and cried with joy i beat the hull lot o yer carol laughed until she cried giving orders meanwhile uncle jack please sit at the head sarah maud at the foot and that will leave four on each side mamma is going to help elfrida so that the children need not look after each other but just have a good time a sprig of holly lay by each plate and nothing would do but each little ruggles must leave his seat and have it pinned on by carol and as each course was served one of them pleaded to take something to her there was hurrying to and fro i can assure you for it is quite a difficult matter to serve a christmas dinner on the third floor of a great city house but if it had been necessary to carry every dish up a rope ladder the servants would gladly have done so there were turkey and chicken with delicious gravy and stuffing and there were half a dozen vegetables with cranberry jelly and celery and pickles and as for the way these delicacies were served the ruggleses never forgot it as long as they lived peter nudged kitty who sat next him and said look will yer ev ry feller s got his own partic lar butter i s pose that s to show you can eat that n no more no it ai nt either for that pig of a peory s just gettin another helpin yes whispered kitty an the napkins is marked with big red letters i wonder if that s so nobody ll nip em an oh peter look at the pictures stickin right on ter the dishes did yee ever the plums is all took out o my cramb ry sarse an it s friz to a stiff jell whispered peoria in wild excitement hi yah i got a wish bone sang larry regardless of sarah maud s frown after which she asked to have his seat changed giving as excuse that he gen ally set beside her an would feel strange the true reason being that she desired to kick him gently under the table whenever he passed what might be termed the mcgrill line i declare to goodness murmured susan on the other side there s so much to look at i ca nt scarcely eat nothin bet yer life i can said peter who had kept one servant busily employed ever since he sat down for luckily no one was asked by uncle jack whether he would have a second helping but the dishes were quietly passed under their noses and not a single ruggles refused anything that was offered him even unto the seventh time then when carol and uncle jack perceived that more turkey was a physical impossibility the meats were taken off and the dessert was brought in a dessert that would have frightened a strong man after such a dinner as had preceded it not so the ruggleses for a strong man is nothing to a small boy and they kindled to the dessert as if the turkey had been a dream and the six vegetables an optical delusion there were plum pudding mince pie and ice cream and there were nuts and raisins and oranges kitty chose ice cream explaining that she knew it by sight though she had nt never tasted none but all the rest took the entire variety without any regard to consequences my dear child whispered uncle jack as he took carol an orange there is no doubt about the necessity of this feast but i do advise you after this to have them twice a year or quarterly perhaps for the way these children eat is positively dangerous i assure you i tremble for that terrible peoria i m going to run races with her after dinner never mind laughed carol let them have enough for once it does my heart good to see them and they shall come oftener next year the feast being over the ruggleses lay back in their chairs languidly like little gorged boa constrictors and the table was cleared in a trice then a door was opened into the next room and there in a corner facing carol s bed which had been wheeled as close as possible stood the brilliantly lighted christmas tree glittering with gilded walnuts and tiny silver balloons and wreathed with snowy chains of pop corn the presents had been bought mostly with carol s story money and were selected after long consultations with mrs bird each girl had a blue knitted hood and each boy a red crocheted comforter all made by
me mr bingham she said presently how can a woman earn her living i mean a girl like myself without any special qualifications some of them get on well he answered that depends upon the girl what sort of a living do you mean you are earning a living now of a kind yes but sometimes if only i could manage it i think that i should like to get away from here and take another line something bigger i do not suppose that i ever shall but i like to think of it sometimes i only know of two things which a woman can turn to he said the stage and literature of course he added hastily the first is out of the question in your case and so is the other i am afraid she answered shaking her head that is if by literature you mean imaginative writing and i suppose that is the only way to get into notice as i told you i lost my imagination well to be frank when i lost my faith at one time i used to have plenty as i used to have plenty of faith but the one went with the other i do not understand why do nt you i think i do a mind without religious sentiment is like a star without atmosphere brighter than other stars but not so soft to see religion poetry music imagination and even some of the more exalted forms of passion flourish in the same soil and are i sometimes think different manifestations of the same thing do you know it is ridiculous to hear you talk of having lost your faith because i do nt believe it at the worst it has gone to sleep and will wake up again one day possibly you may not accept some particular form of faith but i tell you frankly that to reject all religion simply because you cannot understand it is nothing but a form of atrocious spiritual vanity your mind is too big for you miss granger it has run away with you but you know it is tied by a string it cannot go far and now perhaps you will be angry again no indeed why should i be angry i daresay that you are quite right and i only hope that i may be able to believe again i will tell you how i lost belief i had a little brother whom i loved more than anything else in the world indeed after my mother died he was the only thing i really had to love for i think that my father cares more for elizabeth than he does for me she is so much the better at business matters and elizabeth and i never quite got on i daresay that the fault is mine but the fact remains we are sisters but we are not intimate well my brother fell ill of a fever and for a long time he lay between life and death and i prayed for him as i never prayed for anybody or anything before yes i prayed that i might die instead of him then he passed through the crisis and got better and i thanked god thinking that my prayers had been answered oh how happy i was for those ten days and then this happened my brother got a chill a relapse followed and in three days he was dead the last words that he spoke to me were oh do nt let me die bee he used to call me bee please do nt let me die dear bee but he died died in my arms and when it was over i rose from his side feeling as though my heart was dead also i prayed no more after that it seemed to me as though my prayers had been mocked at as though he had been given back to me for a little while in order that the blow might be more crushing when it fell do nt you think that you were a little foolish in taking such a view said geoffrey have you not been amused sometimes to read about the early christians how the lead would not boil the martyr or the lion would not eat him or the rain from a blue sky put out the fire and how the pagan king at once was converted and accepted a great many difficult doctrines without further delay the athanasian creed was not necessarily true because the fire would not light or the sword would not cut nor excuse me were all your old beliefs wrong because your prayer was unanswered it is an ancient story that we cannot tell whether the answering of our petitions will be good or ill for us of course i do not know anything about such things but it seems to me rash to suppose that providence is going to alter the working of its eternal laws merely to suit the passing wishes of individuals wishes too that in many cases would bring unforeseen sorrows if fulfilled besides i daresay that the poor child is happier dead than he would have been had he lived it is not an altogether pleasant world for most of us yes mr bingham i know and i daresay that i should have got over the shock in time only after that i began to read i read the histories of the religions and compared them and i read the works of those writers who have risen up to attack them i found or i thought that i found the same springs of superstition in them all superstitions arising from elementary natural causes and handed on with variations from race to race and time to time in some i found the same story only with a slightly altered face and i learned moreover that each faith denied the other and claimed truth for itself alone after that
new lights upon it poetry and romance however had always the greatest attractions for me how i have wept over the pathos of my heroines and laughed at the comicalities of my buffoons alas i could find no one to join me in my appreciation and solitary admiration for one s self however genuine becomes satiating after a time my father remonstrated with me too on the score of expense and loss of time so that i was finally compelled to relinquish my dreams of literary independence and to become a clerk in a wholesale mercantile firm connected with the west african trade even when condemned to the prosaic duties which fell to my lot in the office i continued faithful to my first love i have introduced pieces of word painting into the most commonplace business letters which have i am told considerably astonished the recipients my refined sarcasm has made defaulting creditors writhe and wince occasionally like the great silas wegg i would drop into poetry and so raise the whole tone of the correspondence thus what could be more elegant than my rendering of the firm s instructions to the captain of one of their vessels it ran in this way from england captain you must steer a course directly to madeira land the casks of salted beef then away to teneriffe pray be careful cool and wary with the merchants of canary when you leave them make the most of the trade winds to the coast down it you shall sail as far as the land of calabar and from there you ll onward go to bonny and fernando po and so on for four pages the captain instead of treasuring up this little gem called at the office next day and demanded with quite unnecessary warmth what the thing meant and i was compelled to translate it all back into prose on this as on other similar occasions my employer took me severely to task for he was you see a man entirely devoid of all pretensions to literary taste all this however is a mere preamble and leads up to the fact that after ten years or so of drudgery i inherited a legacy which though small was sufficient to satisfy my simple wants finding myself independent i rented a quiet house removed from the uproar and bustle of london and there i settled down with the intention of producing some great work which should single me out from the family of the smiths and render my name immortal to this end i laid in several quires of foolscap a box of quill pens and a sixpenny bottle of ink and having given my housekeeper injunctions to deny me to all visitors i proceeded to look round for a suitable subject i was looking round for some weeks at the end of that time i found that i had by constant nibbling devoured a large number of the quills and had spread the ink out to such advantage what with blots spills and abortive commencements that there appeared to be some everywhere except in the bottle as to the story itself however the facility of my youth had deserted me completely and my mind remained a complete blank nor could i do what i would excite my sterile imagination to conjure up a single incident or character in this strait i determined to devote my leisure to running rapidly through the works of the leading english novelists from daniel defoe to the present day in the hope of stimulating my latent ideas and of getting a good grasp of the general tendency of literature for some time past i had avoided opening any work of fiction because one of the greatest faults of my youth had been that i invariably and unconsciously mimicked the style of the last author whom i had happened to read now however i made up my mind to seek safety in a multitude and by consulting all the english classics to avoid the danger of imitating any one too closely i had just accomplished the task of reading through the majority of the standard novels at the time when my narrative commences it was then about twenty minutes to ten on the night of the fourth of june eighteen hundred and eighty six that after disposing of a pint of beer and a welsh rarebit for my supper i seated myself in my arm chair cocked my feet upon a stool and lit my pipe as was my custom both my pulse and my temperature were as far as i know normal at the time i would give the state of the barometer but that unlucky instrument had experienced an unprecedented fall of forty two inches from a nail to the ground and was not in a reliable condition we live in a scientific age and i flatter myself that i move with the times whilst in that comfortable lethargic condition which accompanies both digestion and poisoning by nicotine i suddenly became aware of the extraordinary fact that my little drawing room had elongated into a great salon and that my humble table had increased in proportion round this colossal mahogany were seated a great number of people who were talking earnestly together and the surface in front of them was strewn with books and pamphlets i could not help observing that these persons were dressed in a most extraordinary mixture of costumes for those at the end nearest to me wore peruke wigs swords and all the fashions of two centuries back those about the centre had tight knee breeches high cravats and heavy bunches of seals while among those at the far side the majority were dressed in the most modern style and among them i saw to my surprise several eminent men of letters whom i had the honour of knowing there were two or three women in the company i should have risen to my
miriam herself that an unexpected intimacy was coming about between miriam and mallard for in her frequent thoughts of mallard she had necessarily wondered whether he would ever perceive the true issue of her self will and so far from desiring to blind him she had almost a hope that one day he might know how her life had shaped itself mallard s position in her mind was a singular one in some such way she might have regarded a brother who had always lived remote from her but whom she had every reason to love and reverence her esteem for him was boundless he was the ideal of the artist and at the same time of the nobly strong man had such a thing been possible she would have sought to make him her confidant however it was to be explained she felt no wound to her self respect in supposing him cognizant of all her sufferings rather a solace a source of strength was it in a measure woman s gratitude for love in the course of three years she had seen many reasons for believing that reuben was right that the artist had loved her and gone through dark struggles when her fate was being decided that must have added tenderness to her former regard and admiration but she was glad that he had now recovered his liberty the first meeting his look and the grasp of his hand told her at once that the trouble was long gone by she was glad of this and the proof of her sincerity came when she watched the relations between him and miriam on the last evening miriam came to her room carrying a small portfolio which she opened before her disclosing three water colours you have bought them cecily asked as the other said nothing no mr mallard has given me them was the answer in a voice which affected a careless pleasure they are admirable i am delighted that you take such a present away with you cecily expected no confidences and received none she could only puzzle over the problem why did miriam behave with so strange a coldness her new way of regarding life ought to have resulted in her laying aside that austerity mrs lessingham hinted an opinion that the change did not go very deep puritanism the result of birth and breeding was not so easily eradicated mallard stayed on in rome but during this next week cecily only saw him twice the first time for a quarter of an hour on the pincio then in the forum on that second occasion he was invited to dine with them at the hotel the next day mr seaborne s company having also been requested the result was a delightful evening seaborne was just now busy with a certain period of papal history he talked of some old books he had been reading in the vatican library and revealed a world utterly strange to all his hearers here were men who used their lives to some purpose who rot only planned but executed when the excitement of the evening had subsided cecily thought with more bitterness than ever yet of the contrast between such workers and her husband the feeling which had first come upon her intensely when she stood before mallard s picture at the academy was now growing her habitual mood she had shut herself out for ever from close communion with this world of genuine activity she could only regard it from behind a barrier instead of warming her heart and brain in free enjoyment of its emotions and the worst of it was that these glimpses harmed her injured her morally one cannot dwell with discontent and keep a healthy imagination she knew her danger and it increased the misery with which she looked forward another week and again there was a chance meeting with mallard this time on the via appia where cecily and her aunt were driving they spent a couple of hours together at the parting mallard announced that the next day would see him on his journey to london chapter x elgar at work at dover it was cold and foggy the shore looked mildewed the town rain soaked and mud stained in london a solid leaden sky lowered above the streets neither threatening rain nor allowing a hope of sunlight what a labour breathing had become my heart warms to my native land said spence this is a spring day that recalls one s youth eleanor tried to smile but the railway journey had depressed her beneath the possibility of joking miriam was pallid and miserable she had scarcely spoken since she set foot on the steamboat cab borne through the clangorous streets they seemed a party of exiles the house in chelsea which the spences held on a long lease had been occupied during their absence by edward s brother in law and his family vacated swept and garnished the old furniture from the pantechnicon re established somewhat at haphazard it was not a home that welcomed warmly but one could heap coals on all the fires and draw down the blinds as soon as possible and make a sort of christmas evening if only one s lungs could have free play but in a week or so such little incommodities would become natural again miriam had decided that in a day or two she would go down to bartles not to stay there but merely to see her relative mrs fletcher and redbeck house before leaving london she must visit reuben she had promised cecily to do so without delay this same evening she posted a card to her brother asking him to be at home to see her early the next morning she reached belsize park at ten o clock and dismissed the cab as soon as she had alighted from it her ring at the door was long in being answered and
and of dover lay far on the horizon on the other side a dim haze upon the blue water marked the position of the french coast it was nearly five and the sun was beginning to sink down again in the west when the fisherman after gazing steadily ahead for some time with his horny hand shading his eyes touched ezra on the sleeve see them breakers over there he said pointing over the starboard bow far away ezra could see a long roll of foam breaking the monotony of the broad stretch of ocean them s the goodwins he went on and them craft ahead is at anchor in the downs the vessels in question were miles away but ezra brightened up at the sight of their destination and he once again arranged his toilet and that of his father thank goodness he muttered with a long sigh of relief as he peered at the ships which were growing clearer and larger every moment that outer one is the black eagle or i am much mistaken he s not gone yet that is the black eagle his father said with confidence i know her by the cut of her stern and the rake of her masts as they came nearer still any lingering doubt was finally dispelled there s the white paint line said ezra it s certainly her take us alongside that ship which is lying to the outside there sampson the fisherman looked ahead once more to the barque which has just got her anchor up he said why we wo nt be in time to catch her her anchor up screamed ezra you do nt mean to tell me she s off look at that the man answered as he spoke they saw first one great square of canvas appear above the vessel and then another until she had spread her white wings to their fullest extent do nt say we ca nt catch her cried ezra with a furious oath i tell you man that we must catch her everything depends on that she must take three short tacks before she s out from the goodwins if we run right on as we are going we may get near her before she s free for god s sake clap on all the sail you can get these reefs out with trembling fingers ezra let out the sail and the boat lay over further under the increased pressure is there no other sail that we could put up if we were running we could rig up a spinnaker the fisherman answered but the wind has come round three points we can do no more i think we are catching her john girdlestone cried keeping his eyes fixed upon the barque which was about a mile and a half ahead yes we are now but she hai nt got her way on yet she ll draw ahead presently wo nt she jarge the fisherman s son nodded and burst into hoarse merriment it s better n a race he cried with our necks for a prize ezra muttered to himself it s a little too exciting to be pleasant we are still gaining they had a clear view of the dark hull and towering canvas of the barque as she swept along in front of them intending evidently to take advantage of the wind in order to get outside the goodwins before beating up channel she s going about sampson remarked as he spoke the snow white pile lay over in the opposite direction and the whole broadside of the vessel became visible to them every sail standing out as though carved from ivory against the cold blue sky if we do nt catch her on this tack we wo nt get her at all the fisherman observed when they put about next they ll reach right out into the channel where s something white said ezra excitedly he dived into the cabin and reappeared with a dirty table cloth stand up here father now keep on waving it they may see you i think as we are overhaulin of them remarked the boy we re doing that his father answered the question is will we get near enough to stop em afore they gets off on the next tack the old merchant was standing in the bows waving the signal in the air his son sprang up beside him and flourished his handkerchief they do nt look more than half a mile off let us shout together the two blended their voices in a hoarse roar which was taken up by the boatman and his son once again cried ezra and again their shout resounded over the sea a long drawn cry it was with a ring of despair and of sorrow still the barque kept steadily on her way if they do nt go about we shall catch them the fisherman said if they keep on another five minutes we are right do you hear that ezra cried to his father and they both shouted with new energy and waved their signals they re goin about george burst in it s all up girdlestone groaned as he saw the mainyard swing back they all strained their eyes waiting for the other to follow it remained stationary they have seen us cried the fisherman they are waitin to pick us up then we are saved said ezra stepping down and wiping the perspiration which poured from his forehead go down into the cabin father and put yourself straight you look like a ghost captain hamilton miggs had found the liquor of the cock and cowslip so very much to his taste in spite of its vitriolic peculiarities recorded in a preceding chapter that he rejoined his ship in a very shaky and demoralized condition he was a devout believer in the homoeopathic revelation that like may be cured by like so he forthwith proceeded to set
for it we ranged ourselves with them and unchecked as unbidden sprang on three of the led horses all this passed more quickly than i can relate it so that before our feet were well in the stirrups a partial silence then a mightier roar of anger at once proclaimed and hailed the re appearance of the vidame bigoted beyond belief were the mob of paris of that day cruel vengeful and always athirst for blood and this man had killed not only their leader but a priest he had committed sacrilege what would they do i could just by stooping forward command a side view of the gallery and the scene passing there was such that i forgot in it our own peril for surely in all his reckless life bezers had never been so emphatically the man for the situation had never shown to such advantage as at this moment when he stood confronting the sea of faces the sneer on his lip a smile in his eyes and looked down unblenching a figure of scorn on the men who were literally agape for his life the calm defiance of his steadfast look fascinated even me wonder and admiration for the time took the place of dislike i could scarcely believe that there was not some atom of good in this man so fearless and no face but one no face i think in the world but one could have drawn my eyes from him but that one face was beside him i clutched marie s arm and pointed to the bareheaded figure at bezers right hand it was louis himself our louis de pavannes but he was changed indeed from the gay cavalier i remembered and whom i had last seen riding down the street at caylus smiling back at us and waving his adieux to his mistress beside the vidame he had the air of being slight even short the face which i had known so bright and winning was now white and set his fair curling hair scarce darker than croisette s hung dank bedabbled with blood which flowed from a wound in his head his sword was gone his dress was torn and disordered and covered with dust his lips moved but he held up his head he bore himself bravely with it all so bravely that i choked and my heart seemed bursting as i looked at him standing there forlorn and now unarmed i knew that kit seeing him thus would gladly have died with him and i thanked god she did not see him yet there was a quietness in his fortitude which made a great difference between his air and that of bezers he lacked as became one looking unarmed on certain death the sneer and smile of the giant beside him what was the vidame about to do i shuddered as i asked myself not surrender him not fling him bodily to the people no not that i felt sure he would let no others share his vengeance that his pride would not suffer that and even while i wondered the doubt was solved i saw bezers raise his hand in a peculiar fashion simultaneously a cry rang sharply out above the tumult and down in headlong charge towards the farther steps came the band of horsemen who had got clear of the crowd on that side they were but ten or twelve but under his eye they charged as if they had been a thousand the rabble shrank from the collision and fled aside quick as thought the riders swerved and changing their course galloped through the looser part of the throng and in a trice drew rein side by side with us a laugh and a jeer on their reckless lips it was neatly done and while it was being done the vidame and his knot of men with those who had been searching the building hurried down the gallery towards us their rear cleared for the moment by the troopers feint the dismounted men came bundling down the steps their eyes aglow with the war fire and got horses as they could among them i lost sight of louis but perceived him presently pale and bewildered mounted behind a trooper a man sprang up before each of us too greeting our appearance merely by a grunt of surprise for it was no time to ask or answer the mob was recovering itself and each moment brought it reinforcements while its fury was augmented by the trick we had played it and the prospect of our escape we were under forty all told and some men were riding double bezers eye glanced hastily over his array and lit on us three he turned and gave some order to his lieutenant the fellow spurred his horse a splendid grey as powerful as his master s alongside of croisette threw his arm round the lad and dragged him dexterously on to his own crupper i did not understand the action but i saw croisette settle himself behind blaise bure for he it was and supposed no harm was intended the next moment we had surged forward and were swaying to and fro in the midst of the crowd what ensued i cannot tell the outlook so far as i was concerned was limited to wildly plunging horses we were in the centre of the band and riders swaying in the saddle with a glimpse here and there of a fringe of white scowling faces and tossing arms once a lane opening i saw the vidame s charger he was in the van stumble and fall among the crowd and heard a great shout go up but bezers by a mighty effort lifted it to its legs again and once too a minute later those riding on my right swerved outwards and i saw something i never afterwards forgot it was the body of the coadjutor lying face upwards the
table quite erect and holding on by her fierce young claws she stopped to mew with pathos at each elbow or darted off to the open door when a song sparrow forgot himself and lit in the grass too near william did not talk much but his sister todd occupied the time and told all the news there was to tell of dunnet landing and its coasts while the old mother listened with delight her hospitality was something exquisite she had the gift which so many women lack of being able to make themselves and their houses belong entirely to a guest s pleasure that charming surrender for the moment of themselves and whatever belongs to them so that they make a part of one s own life that can never be forgotten tact is after all a kind of mindreading and my hostess held the golden gift sympathy is of the mind as well as the heart and mrs blackett s world and mine were one from the moment we met besides she had that final that highest gift of heaven a perfect self forgetfulness sometimes as i watched her eager sweet old face i wondered why she had been set to shine on this lonely island of the northern coast it must have been to keep the balance true and make up to all her scattered and depending neighbors for other things which they may have lacked when we had finished clearing away the old blue plates and the kitten had taken care of her share of the fresh haddock just as we were putting back the kitchen chairs in their places mrs todd said briskly that she must go up into the pasture now to gather the desired herbs you can stop here an rest or you can accompany me she announced mother ought to have her nap and when we come back she an william ll sing for you she admires music said mrs todd turning to speak to her mother but mrs blackett tried to say that she could nt sing as she used and perhaps william would nt feel like it she looked tired the good old soul or i should have liked to sit in the peaceful little house while she slept i had had much pleasant experience of pastures already in her daughter s company but it seemed best to go with mrs todd and off we went mrs todd carried the gingham bag which she had brought from home and a small heavy burden in the bottom made it hang straight and slender from her hand the way was steep and she soon grew breathless so that we sat down to rest awhile on a convenient large stone among the bayberry there i wanted you to see this tis mother s picture said mrs todd twas taken once when she was up to portland soon after she was married that s me she added opening another worn case and displaying the full face of the cheerful child she looked like still in spite of being past sixty and here s william an father together i take after father large and heavy an william is like mother s folks short an thin he ought to have made something o himself bein a man an so like mother but though he s been very steady to work an kept up the farm an done his fishin too right along he never had mother s snap an power o seein things just as they be he s got excellent judgment too meditated william s sister but she could not arrive at any satisfactory decision upon what she evidently thought his failure in life i think it is well to see any one so happy an makin the most of life just as it falls to hand she said as she began to put the daguerreotypes away again but i reached out my hand to see her mother s once more a most flowerlike face of a lovely young woman in quaint dress there was in the eyes a look of anticipation and joy a far off look that sought the horizon one often sees it in seafaring families inherited by girls and boys alike from men who spend their lives at sea and are always watching for distant sails or the first loom of the land at sea there is nothing to be seen close by and this has its counterpart in a sailor s character in the large and brave and patient traits that are developed the hopeful pleasantness that one loves so in a seafarer when the family pictures were wrapped again in a big handkerchief we set forward in a narrow footpath and made our way to a lonely place that faced northward where there was more pasturage and fewer bushes and we went down to the edge of short grass above some rocky cliffs where the deep sea broke with a great noise though the wind was down and the water looked quiet a little way from shore among the grass grew such pennyroyal as the rest of the world could not provide there was a fine fragrance in the air as we gathered it sprig by sprig and stepped along carefully and mrs todd pressed her aromatic nosegay between her hands and offered it to me again and again there s nothin like it she said oh no there s no such pennyr yal as this in the state of maine it s the right pattern of the plant and all the rest i ever see is but an imitation do nt it do you good and i answered with enthusiasm there dear i never showed nobody else but mother where to find this place tis kind of sainted to me nathan my husband an i used to love this place when we was courtin and she hesitated and then spoke softly when he was lost twas just off
times welcome to our home dear aunt if you will let me call you that and and i shall use my influence to have father invite you to share our humble home forever if you only will no no bernardine replied miss rogers you have mouths enough to earn bread for one more would not signify declared bernardine and your presence beneath this roof would amply compensate me i would take a world of pleasure in working a little harder than i do now to keep you here before you give me too much hope on that point you had better talk it over with your father he may think differently from what you do he may not want to keep a tramp s boarding house she added quietly father will be sure to think as i do reiterated bernardine he has a rough exterior but the kindest of hearts beats in his rugged bosom you are right there bernardine said david moore pushing open an inner door and coming forward i could not help overhearing all that passed between you two i am sorry you have lost all your money miss rogers but that will not make any difference in the heartiness of the welcome we give you and if bernardine wants you to stay here with us stay you shall so take off your bonnet and make yourself at home chapter xix true love never does run smooth miss rogers was quite overcome by the hearty welcome she received from david moore the old basket maker and bernardine his lovely daughter it went straight to her lonely heart because she knew it was genuine friendship untainted by mercenary motives she shared bernardine s humble yet dainty apartment and fell quite naturally into being a member of the household there was one thing which puzzled her greatly and that was the sighs that would rend sweet bernardine s breast while she was sleeping the girl has some secret sorrow which she is hiding from the world she thought anxiously i must find out what it is she had been an inmate of bernardine s home for a week before she learned that the girl was soon to be wedded bernardine s father told her hinting triumphantly that that event would mean the dawn of a more prosperous future for the family as her intended husband was very rich had money to burn do nt say much about him to bernardine he added quickly for she s not in love with him by any means then why is she going to marry him asked miss rogers amazedly he has money replied david moore nodding his head wisely and that s what sharp girls are looking for nowadays i thought love was the ruling power which moved young girls hearts responded miss rogers slowly at least it used to be when i was a young girl like bernardine he laughed uneasily but made no reply as bernardine entered the room at that instant with an open letter in her hand jasper wilde has returned to the city father she said tremulously and and he is coming here this evening to see us as the girl uttered the words miss rogers was quite sure she could detect the sound of tears in her quivering voice i am very glad replied david moore endeavoring to speak lightly i shall be mighty pleased to see my prospective son in law bernardine drew back quickly her lovely face pitifully pale then turned abruptly and hurried from the room miss rogers followed her the girl went to her own apartment threw herself on her knees and burying her face in the counterpane wept such bitter passionate tears that miss rogers was alarmed for her you poor child exclaimed miss rogers sit down here beside me and tell me the whole story let me understand it i can not tell you any more i met one whom i could love and we parted i sent him away because my father had declared that i should marry this other one because of his wealth said miss rogers in a strangely hard voice no no do not do my father that injustice it was not because of his wealth i i should have had to marry him had he been the poorest man in the city it is cruel it is outrageous to ask a young girl to marry a man whom she detests it is barbarous in my opinion that is carrying parental authority too far this marriage must not take place bernardine it would be wicked a sin against god although miss rogers did her best to probe into the mystery for bernardine s sake the girl was strangely obdurate so she said no more to her on the subject just then but when she approached david moore on this topic his incoherent replies puzzled her still more i am much obliged to you for taking such an interest in bernardine s affairs but let me warn you of one thing miss rogers while you are under my roof do nt attempt to meddle with what does not concern you in any way by heeding my remark we shall keep good friends this marriage must take place the young fellow is good enough and she ll get to like him after awhile see if she does nt the harsh abrupt manner in which he uttered these words told miss rogers that little hope could be entertained from that source bernardine had almost cried herself ill by the time jasper wilde s knock was heard on the door mr moore answered the summons is there any use in my coming in asked wilde grimly coming to a halt on the threshold does your daughter consent to marry me i could not make head or tail out of your letter bernardine s answer is yes murmured the old man almost incoherently she consents for my sake though heaven knows

cards aside mercy exclaimed edna who had been fuming why are you taking the thing so seriously and making such a fuss over it i m not making any fuss over it but it s just such seeming trifles that we ve got to take seriously such things count the fish was scorched mr pontellier would not touch it edna said she did not mind a little scorched taste the roast was in some way not to his fancy and he did not like the manner in which the vegetables were served it seems to me he said we spend money enough in this house to procure at least one meal a day which a man could eat and retain his self respect you used to think the cook was a treasure returned edna indifferently perhaps she was when she first came but cooks are only human they need looking after like any other class of persons that you employ suppose i did nt look after the clerks in my office just let them run things their own way they d soon make a nice mess of me and my business where are you going asked edna seeing that her husband arose from table without having eaten a morsel except a taste of the highly seasoned soup i m going to get my dinner at the club good night he went into the hall took his hat and stick from the stand and left the house she was somewhat familiar with such scenes they had often made her very unhappy on a few previous occasions she had been completely deprived of any desire to finish her dinner sometimes she had gone into the kitchen to administer a tardy rebuke to the cook once she went to her room and studied the cookbook during an entire evening finally writing out a menu for the week which left her harassed with a feeling that after all she had accomplished no good that was worth the name but that evening edna finished her dinner alone with forced deliberation her face was flushed and her eyes flamed with some inward fire that lighted them after finishing her dinner she went to her room having instructed the boy to tell any other callers that she was indisposed it was a large beautiful room rich and picturesque in the soft dim light which the maid had turned low she went and stood at an open window and looked out upon the deep tangle of the garden below all the mystery and witchery of the night seemed to have gathered there amid the perfumes and the dusky and tortuous outlines of flowers and foliage she was seeking herself and finding herself in just such sweet half darkness which met her moods but the voices were not soothing that came to her from the darkness and the sky above and the stars they jeered and sounded mournful notes without promise devoid even of hope she turned back into the room and began to walk to and fro down its whole length without stopping without resting she carried in her hands a thin handkerchief which she tore into ribbons rolled into a ball and flung from her once she stopped and taking off her wedding ring flung it upon the carpet when she saw it lying there she stamped her heel upon it striving to crush it but her small boot heel did not make an indenture not a mark upon the little glittering circlet in a sweeping passion she seized a glass vase from the table and flung it upon the tiles of the hearth she wanted to destroy something the crash and clatter were what she wanted to hear a maid alarmed at the din of breaking glass entered the room to discover what was the matter a vase fell upon the hearth said edna never mind leave it till morning oh you might get some of the glass in your feet ma am insisted the young woman picking up bits of the broken vase that were scattered upon the carpet and here s your ring ma am under the chair edna held out her hand and taking the ring slipped it upon her finger xviii the following morning mr pontellier upon leaving for his office asked edna if she would not meet him in town in order to look at some new fixtures for the library i hardly think we need new fixtures leonce do nt let us get anything new you are too extravagant i do nt believe you ever think of saving or putting by the way to become rich is to make money my dear edna not to save it he said he regretted that she did not feel inclined to go with him and select new fixtures he kissed her good by and told her she was not looking well and must take care of herself she was unusually pale and very quiet she stood on the front veranda as he quitted the house and absently picked a few sprays of jessamine that grew upon a trellis near by she inhaled the odor of the blossoms and thrust them into the bosom of her white morning gown the boys were dragging along the
found them his life had shaped itself was no doubt to continue always along these same lines a woman had entered his small world and instantly there was discord the disturbing element had appeared wherever the woman had put her foot a score of distressing complications had sprung up like the sudden growth of strange and puzzling flowers say mac go on let s have ut straight urged marcus leaning toward him has any duck been doing you dirt he cried his face crimson on the instant no said mcteague helplessly come along old man persisted marcus let s have ut what is the row i ll do all i can to help you it was more than mcteague could bear the situation had got beyond him stupidly he spoke his hands deep in his pockets his head rolled forward it s it s miss sieppe he said trina my cousin how do you mean inquired marcus sharply i i i don know stammered mcteague hopelessly confounded you mean cried marcus suddenly enlightened that you are that you too mcteague stirred in his chair looking at the walls of the room avoiding the other s glance he nodded his head then suddenly broke out i ca nt help it it ai nt my fault is it marcus was struck dumb he dropped back in his chair breathless suddenly mcteague found his tongue i tell you mark i ca nt help it i do nt know how it happened it came on so slow that i was that that that it was done before i knew it before i could help myself i know we re pals us two and i knew how how you and miss sieppe were i know now i knew then but that would nt have made any difference before i knew it it it there i was i ca nt help it i would nt a had ut happen for anything if i could a stopped it but i don know it s something that s just stronger than you are that s all she came there miss sieppe came to the parlors there three or four times a week and she was the first girl i had ever known and you don know why i was so close to her i touched her face every minute and her mouth and smelt her hair and her breath oh you do nt know anything about it i ca nt give you any idea i don know exactly myself i only know how i m fixed i i it s been done it s too late there s no going back why i ca nt think of anything else night and day it s everything it s it s oh it s everything i i why mark it s everything i ca nt explain he made a helpless movement with both hands never had mcteague been so excited never had he made so long a speech his arms moved in fierce uncertain gestures his face flushed his enormous jaws shut together with a sharp click at every pause it was like some colossal brute trapped in a delicate invisible mesh raging exasperated powerless to extricate himself marcus schouler said nothing there was a long silence marcus got up and walked to the window and stood looking out but seeing nothing well who would have thought of this he muttered under his breath here was a fix marcus cared for trina there was no doubt in his mind about that he looked forward eagerly to the sunday afternoon excursions he liked to be with trina he too felt the charm of the little girl the charm of the small pale forehead the little chin thrust out as if in confidence and innocence the heavy odorous crown of black hair he liked her immensely some day he would speak he would ask her to marry him marcus put off this matter of marriage to some future period it would be some time a year perhaps or two the thing did not take definite shape in his mind marcus kept company with his cousin trina but he knew plenty of other girls for the matter of that he liked all girls pretty well just now the singleness and strength of mcteague s passion startled him mcteague would marry trina that very afternoon if she would have him but would he marcus no he would not if it came to that no he would not yet he knew he liked trina he could say yes he could say he loved her she was his girl the sieppes acknowledged him as trina s young man marcus came back to the table and sat down sideways upon it well what are we going to do about it mac he said i don know answered mcteague in great distress i don want anything to to come between us mark well nothun will you bet vociferated the other no sir you bet not mac marcus was thinking hard he could see very clearly that mcteague loved trina more than he did that in some strange way this huge brutal fellow was capable of a greater passion than himself who was twice as clever suddenly marcus jumped impetuously to a resolution well say mac he cried striking the table with his fist go ahead i guess you you want her pretty bad i ll pull out yes i will i ll give her up to you old man the sense of his own magnanimity all at once overcame marcus he saw himself as another man very noble self sacrificing he stood apart and watched this second self with boundless admiration and with infinite pity he was so good so magnificent so heroic that he almost sobbed marcus made a sweeping gesture of resignation throwing out both his arms crying mac i ll give her up to you i wo nt stand between you there were actually tears
again meanwhile i took charge of the nursing of sebastian fortunately i had brought with me a good stock of jungle medicines in my little travelling case including plenty of quinine and under my careful treatment the professor passed the crisis and began to mend slowly the first question he asked me when he felt himself able to talk once more was nurse wade what has become of her for he had not yet seen her i feared the shock for him she is here with me i answered in a very measured voice she is waiting to be allowed to come and help me in taking care of you he shuddered and turned away his face buried itself in the pillow i could see some twinge of remorse had seized upon him at last he spoke cumberledge he said in a very low and almost frightened tone do nt let her come near me i ca nt bear it i ca nt bear it ill as he was i did not mean to let him think i was ignorant of his motive you ca nt bear a woman whose life you have attempted i said in my coldest and most deliberate way to have a hand in nursing you you ca nt bear to let her heap coals of fire on your head in that you are right but remember you have attempted my life too you have twice done your best to get me murdered he did not pretend to deny it he was too weak for subterfuges he only writhed as he lay you are a man he said shortly and she is a woman that is all the difference then he paused for a minute or two do nt let her come near me he moaned once more in a piteous voice do nt let her come near me i will not i answered she shall not come near you i spare you that but you will have to eat the food she prepares and you know she will not poison you you will have to be tended by the servants she chooses and you know they will not murder you she can heap coals of fire on your head without coming into your tent consider that you sought to take her life and she seeks to save yours she is as anxious to keep you alive as you are anxious to kill her he lay as in a reverie his long white hair made his clear cut thin face look more unearthly than ever with the hectic flush of fever upon it at last he turned to me we each work for our own ends he said in a weary way we pursue our own objects it suits me to get rid of her it suits her to keep me alive i am no good to her dead living she expects to wring a confession out of me but she shall not have it tenacity of purpose is the one thing i admire in life she has the tenacity of purpose and so have i cumberledge do nt you see it is a mere duel of endurance between us and may the just side win i answered solemnly it was several days later before he spoke to me of it again hilda had brought some food to the door of the tent and passed it in to me for our patient how is he now she whispered sebastian overheard her voice and cowering within himself still managed to answer better getting better i shall soon be well now you have carried your point you have cured your enemy thank god for that hilda said and glided away silently sebastian ate his cup of arrowroot in silence then he looked at me with wistful musing eyes cumberledge he murmured at last after all i ca nt help admiring that woman she is the only person who has ever checkmated me she checkmates me every time steadfastness is what i love her steadfastness of purpose and her determination move me i wish they would move you to tell the truth i answered he mused again to tell the truth he muttered moving his head up and down i have lived for science shall i wreck all now there are truths which it is better to hide than to proclaim uncomfortable truths truths that never should have been truths which help to make greater truths incredible but all the same i cannot help admiring that woman she has yorke bannerman s intellect with a great deal more than yorke bannerman s force of will such firmness such energy such resolute patience she is a wonderful creature i ca nt help admiring her i said no more to him just then i thought it better to let nascent remorse and nascent admiration work out their own natural effects unimpeded for i could see our enemy was beginning to feel some sting of remorse some men are below it sebastian thought himself above it i felt sure he was mistaken yet even in the midst of these personal preoccupations i saw that our great teacher was still as ever the pure man of science he noted every symptom and every change of the disease with professional accuracy he observed his own case whenever his mind was clear enough as impartially as he would have observed any outside patient s this is a rare chance cumberledge he whispered to me once in an interval of delirium so few europeans have ever had the complaint and probably none who were competent to describe the specific subjective and psychological symptoms the delusions one gets as one sinks into the coma for example are of quite a peculiar type delusions of wealth and of absolute power most exhilarating and magnificent i think myself a millionaire or a prime minister be sure you make a note of that in case i die if i recover
depends whether or not i shall entrust you with knowledge regarding him swear to me by the three kings of cologne that you will tell to none what i will now impart to you i swear said elsa raising her right hand and holding aloft the sword with it wilhelm is not my son nor is he kin to either of us but is the heir of the greatest enemy of our house count herbert of schonburg i lured him from his father s home as a child and now send him back as a man some time later i shall acquaint the count with the fact that the young man he captured is his only son the girl looked at her uncle her eyes wide with horror it is your purpose then that the father shall execute his own son the outlaw shrugged his shoulders the result lies not with me but with the count he was once a crusader and the teaching of his master is to the effect that the measure he metes to others the same shall be meted to him if i remember aright the tenets of his faith count herbert wreaking vengeance upon my supposed son is really bringing destruction upon his own which seems but justice if he show mercy to me and mine he is bestowing the blessed balm thereof on himself and his house in this imperfect world few events are ordered with such admirable equity as the capture of young lord wilhelm by that haughty and bloodthirsty warrior his father let us then await with patience the outcome taking care not to interfere with the designs of providence the design comes not from god but from the evil one himself it is within the power of the deity to overturn even the best plans of the fiend if it be his will let us see to it that we do not intervene between two such ghostly potentates remembering that we are but puny creatures liable to err the plot is of your making secretly held all these years with unrelenting malignity the devil himself is not wicked enough to send an innocent loyal lad to his doom in his own mother s house with his father as his executioner oh uncle uncle repent and make reparation before it is too late let the count repent and make reparation i have now nothing to do with the matter as i have said if the count is merciful he is like to be glad of it later in his life if he is revengeful visiting the sin of the father on the son innocent i think you called him then he deserves what his own hand deals out to himself but we have talked too much already i ask you to remember your oath for i have told you this so that you will not bring ridicule upon me by a womanish appeal to my own men who would but laugh at you in any case and think me a dotard in allowing women overmuch to say in the camp get you back to your women for we move camp instantly even if i were to relent as you term it the time is past for wilhelm is either dangling from the walls of castle schonburg or he is pardoned and all that we could do would be of little avail prepare you then instantly for our journey elsa with a sigh went slowly to the women s quarters her oath the most terrible that may be taken on the rhine weighing heavily upon her resolving not to break it yet determined in some way to save wilhelm the girl spent the first part of the journey in revolving plans of escape for she found as the cavalcade progressed that her uncle did not trust entirely to the binding qualities of the oath she had taken but had her closely watched as well as the expedition progressed farther and farther south in the direction of mayence vigilance was relaxed and on the evening of the second day when a camp had been selected for the night elsa escaped and hurried eastward through the forest until she came to the rhine which was to be her guide to the castle of schonburg the windings of the river made the return longer than the direct journey through the wilderness had been and in addition to this elsa was compelled to circumambulate the numerous castles climbing the hills to avoid them fearing capture and delay so it was not until the sun was declining on the sixth day after the assault on the castle that she stood weary and tattered and unkempt before the closed gates of schonburg and beat feebly with her small hand against the oak crying for admittance the guard of the gate seeing through the small lattice but a single dishevelled woman standing there anticipating treachery refused to open the little door in the large leaf until his captain was summoned who after some parley allowed the girl to enter the courtyard what do you want asked the captain curtly she asked instead of answered is your prisoner still alive the son of the outlaw yes but he would be a confident prophet who would predict as much for him at this hour to morrow take me i beg of you to the countess that is as it may be who are you and what is your business with her i shall reveal myself to her ladyship and to her will state the object of my coming your object is plain enough you are some tatterdemalion of the forest come to beg the life of your lover who hangs to morrow or i am a heathen saracen i do beseech you tell the countess that a miserable woman craves permission to speak with her what success might have attended her petition is uncertain but the problem was solved by the appearance
and as such to be honored by those who call themselves his friends and she is not to be lightly spoken of nor comment passed upon her grace beauty and bearing something too great for her station i admit lest idle tales should get abroad am i not thy friend ralph he asked with smiling eyes i have thought so at times i answered my friend s honor is my honor he went on where his lips are sealed mine open not art content content i said and pressed the hand he held out to me we reached the steps of the wharf and descending them he entered his barge rocking lazily with the advancing tide his rowers cast loose from the piles and the black water slowly widened between us from over my shoulder came a sudden bright gleam of light from the house above and i knew that mistress percy was as usual wasting good pine knots i had a vision of the many lights within and of the beauty whom the world called my wife sitting erect bathed in that rosy glow in the great armchair with the turbaned negress behind her i suppose rolfe saw the same thing for he looked from the light to me and i heard him draw his breath ralph percy thou art the very button upon the cap of fortune he said to myself my laugh sounded something of the bitterest but to him i presume it vaunted my return through the darkness to the lit room and its resplendent pearl he waved farewell and the dusk swallowed up him and his boat i went back to the house and to her she was sitting as we had left her with her small feet crossed upon the cushion beneath them her hands folded in her silken lap the air from the waving fan blowing tendrils of her dark hair against her delicate standing ruff i went and leaned against the window facing her i have been chosen burgess for this hundred i said abruptly the assembly meets next week i must be in jamestown then and for some time to come she took the fan from the negress and waved it lazily to and fro when do we go she asked at last we i answered i had thought to go alone the fan dropped to the floor and her eyes opened wide and leave me here she exclaimed leave me in these woods at the mercy of indians wolves and your rabble of servants i smiled we are at peace with the indians it would be a stout wolf that could leap this palisade and the servants know their master too well to care to offend their mistress moreover i would leave diccon in charge diccon she cried the old woman in the kitchen hath told me tales of diccon diccon bravo diccon gamester diccon cutthroat granted i said but diccon faithful as well i can trust him but i do not trust him she retorted and i wish to go to jamestown this forest wearies me her tone was imperious i must think it over i said coolly i may take you or i may not i cannot tell yet but i desire to go sir and i may desire you to stay you are a churl i bowed i am the man of your choice madam she rose with a stamp of her foot and turning her back upon me took a flower from the table and commenced to pull from it its petals i unsheathed my sword and seating myself began to polish away a speck of rust upon the blade ten minutes later i looked up from the task to receive full in my face a red rose tossed from the other side of the room the missile was followed by an enchanting burst of laughter we cannot afford to quarrel can we cried mistress jocelyn percy life is sad enough in this solitude without that nothing but trees and water all day long and not a soul to speak to and i am horribly afraid of the indians what if they were to kill me while you were away you know you swore before the minister to protect me you wo nt leave me to the mercies of the savages will you and i may go to jamestown may nt i i want to go to church i want to go to the governor s house i want to buy a many things i have gold in plenty and but this one decent dress you ll take me with you wo nt you there s not your like in virginia i told her if you go to town clad like that and with that bearing there will be talk enough and ships come and go and there are those besides rolfe who have been to london for a moment the laughter died from her eyes and lips but it returned let them talk she said what care i and i do not think your ship captains your traders and adventurers do often dine with my lord bishop this barbarous forest world and another world that i wot of are so far apart that the inhabitants of the one do not trouble those of the other in that petty village down there i am safe enough besides sir you wear a sword my sword is ever at your service madam then i may go to jamestown if you will it so with her bright eyes upon me and with one hand softly striking a rose against her laughing lips she extended the other hand you may kiss it if you wish sir she said demurely i knelt and kissed the white fingers and four days later we went to jamestown chapter vi in which we go to jamestown it was early morning when we set out on horseback for jamestown i rode in front with mistress
see what george hagar saw in mark telford s looks telford s glance went round the crowd appearing to rest for an instant on every person and for a longer time on hagar the eyes of the two men met both were immediately puzzled for each had a sensation of some subterranean origin telford immediately afterward passed out of the gate and went toward the st cloud gardens where the band was playing for a time hagar did not stir but idled with his pencil and notebook suddenly he started and hurried out in the direction telford had gone i was an ass he said to himself not to think of that at first he entered the st cloud gardens and walked round the promenade a few times but without finding him presently however alpheus richmond whose beautiful and brilliant waistcoat and brass buttons with monogram adorned showed advantageously in the morning sunshine said to him i say hagar who s that chap up there filling the door of the summer house lord rather it was telford hagar wished for the slightest pretext to go up the unfrequented side path and speak to him but his mind was too excited to do the thing naturally without a stout pretext besides though he admired the man s proportions and his uses from an artistic standpoint he did not like him personally and he said that he never could he had instinctive likes and dislikes what had startled him at the pump room and had made him come to the gardens was the conviction that this was the man to play the part in the scene which described by mrs detlor had been arranging itself in a hundred ways in his brain during the night the central figures always the same the details light tone coloring expression fusing resolving then came another and still more significant thought on this he had acted when he had got rid of richmond who begged that he would teach him how to arrange a tie as he did for which an hour was appointed he determined at all hazards to speak he had a cigar in his pocket and though to smoke in the morning was pain and grief to him he determined to ask for a match and started he was stopped by baron whose thoughts being much with the little vices of man anticipated his wishes and offered him a light in despair hagar took it and asked if he chanced to know who the stranger was baron did know assuring hagar that he sat on the gentleman s right at the same table in his hotel and was qualified to introduce him before they started he told the artist of the occurrence of the evening before and further assured him of the graces of miss mildred margrave a pearl he said not to be reckoned by loads of ivory nor jolly bricks of gold nor caravans of arab steeds nor come and have dinner with me to night and you shall see there what do you say hagar who loved the man s unique and spontaneous character as only an artist can love a subject in which he sees royal possibilities consented gladly and dropped a cordial hand on the other s shoulder the hand was dragged down and wrenched back and forth with a sturdy clasp in time to a roll of round unctuous laughter then baron took him up hurriedly and introduced him to telford with the words you two ought to know each other telford traveler officer of the hudson s bay company et cetera hagar artist good fellow et cetera then he drew back and smiled as the two men not shaking hands as he expected bowed and said they were happy to meet the talk began with the remark by hagar on the panorama below them that the thing was amusing if not seen too often but the eternal paddling round the band stand was too much like marionettes you prefer a punch and judy to marionettes asked telford yes you get a human element in a punch and judy tragedy besides it has surprises according to the idiosyncrasy of the man in the greenroom he smiled immediately remembering that his last words plagiarized mr alpheus richmond i never miss a punch and judy if i m near it said telford i enjoy the sardonic humor with which punch hustles off his victims his light heartedness when doing bloody deeds is the true temper that is if it must be done to do it with a grin is is the most absolute tragedy hagar was astonished for even the trader s information that telford spoke excellent french and had certainly been a deal on red carpet in his time did not prepare him for the sharply incisive words just uttered yet it was not incongruous with telford s appearance not even with the red sash peeping at the edge of his waistcoat they came down among the promenaders and baron being accosted by some one he left the two together exacting anew the promise from hagar regarding dinner presently hagar looked up and said abruptly you were singing outside my window last night telford s face was turned away from him when he began it came slowly toward him the eyes closed steadily with his there was no excitement only cold alertness indeed what was i singing for one thing the chant of the negro woodcutters of louisiana what part of louisiana the county of tellavie chiefly telford drew a long breath as though some suspense was over and then said how did you know it was i i could scarcely tell you i got the impression besides you are the only man i ve seen in herridon who looks likely to know it and the song which you prompted do i look like a southerner still you see i ve been in an arctic country five years
and for the last time stand face to face with the ghost of the dead in the home of the dead o white heart and black body i look into your heart and it is white as milk and the milk of innocence shall save it fool why do you strike that blow let him be who is loved of the tiger and whose love is as the love of a tiger ah what face is that in the battle follow it follow it o swift of foot but follow warily for the tongue that has lied will never plead for mercy and the hand that can betray is strong in war white heart what is death in death life lives and among the dead you shall find the life you lost for there awaits you she whom kings and waters cannot harm as the bee spoke by degrees her voice sank lower and lower till it was almost inaudible then it ceased altogether and she seemed to pass from trance to sleep hadden who had been listening to her with an amused and cynical smile now laughed aloud why do you laugh white man asked nahoon angrily i laugh at my own folly in wasting time listening to the nonsense of that lying fraud it is no nonsense white man indeed then will you tell me what it means i cannot tell you what it means yet but her words have to do with a woman and a leopard and with your fate and my fate hadden shrugged his shoulders not thinking the matter worth further argument and at that moment the bee woke up shivering drew the red snake from her head dress and coiling it about her throat wrapped herself again in the greasy kaross are you satisfied with my wisdom inkoos she asked of hadden i am satisfied that you are one of the cleverest cheats in zululand mother he answered coolly now what is there to pay the bee took no offence at this rude speech though for a second or two the look in her eyes grew strangely like that which they had seen in those of the snake when the fumes of the fire made it angry if the white lord says i am a cheat it must be so she answered for he of all men should be able to discern a cheat i have said that i ask no fee yes give me a little tobacco from your pouch hadden opened the bag of antelope hide and drawing some tobacco from it gave it to her in taking it she clasped his hand and examined the gold ring that was upon the third finger a ring fashioned like a snake with two little rubies set in the head to represent the eyes i wear a snake about my neck and you wear one upon your hand inkoos i should like to have this ring to wear upon my hand so that the snake about my neck may be less lonely there then i am afraid you will have to wait till i am dead said hadden yes yes she answered in a pleased voice it is a good word i will wait till you are dead and then i will take the ring and none can say that i have stolen it for nahoon there will bear me witness that you gave me permission to do so for the first time hadden started since there was something about the bee s tone that jarred upon him had she addressed him in her professional manner he would have thought nothing of it but in her cupidity she had become natural and it was evident that she spoke from conviction believing her own words she saw him start and instantly changed her note let the white lord forgive the jest of a poor old witch doctoress she said in a whining voice i have so much to do with death that his name leaps to my lips and she glanced first at the circle of skulls about her then towards the waterfall that fed the gloomy pool upon whose banks her hut was placed look she said simply following the line of her outstretched hand hadden s eyes fell upon two withered mimosa trees which grew over the fall almost at right angles to its rocky edge these trees were joined together by a rude platform made of logs of wood lashed down with riems of hide upon this platform stood three figures notwithstanding the distance and the spray of the fall he could see that they were those of two men and a girl for their shapes stood out distinctly against the fiery red of the sunset sky one instant there were three the next there were two for the girl had gone and something dark rushing down the face of the fall struck the surface of the pool with a heavy thud while a faint and piteous cry broke upon his ear what is the meaning of that he asked horrified and amazed nothing answered the bee with a laugh do you not know then that this is the place where faithless women or girls who have loved without the leave of the king are brought to meet their death and with them their accomplices oh they die here thus each day and i watch them die and keep the count of the number of them and drawing a tally stick from the thatch of the hut she took a knife and added a notch to the many that appeared upon it looking at nahoon the while with a half questioning half warning gaze yes yes it is a place of death she muttered up yonder the quick die day by day and down there and she pointed along the course of the river beyond the pool to where the forest began some two hundred yards from her hut the ghosts
rather timidly at the counter walk right up those stairs and turn to the left said a clerk as he opened a gate for me ascending i met a big man coming down hurriedly and with heavy steps we stood dodging each other a moment with that unfortunate co ordination of purpose men sometimes encounter when passing each other suddeniy the big man stopped in the middle of the stairway and held both of his hands above his head in god s name young man said he take your choice he spoke in a high squeaky voice that cut me with the sharpness of its irritation i went on past him and entered an open door near the top of the stairway is mr horace greeley in i enquired of a young man who sat reading papers back soon said he without looking up take a chair in a little while i heard the same heavy feet ascending the stairway two steps at a time then the man i had met came hurriedly into the room this is mr greeley said the yo mg man who was reading the great editor turned and looked at me through gold rimmed spectacles i gave him my letter out of a trembling hand he removed it from the envelope and held it close to his big kindly smooth shaven face there was a fringe of silky silver hair streaked with yellow about the lower part of his head from temple to temple it also encircled his throat from under his collar his cheeks were fall and fair as a lady s with rosy spots in them and a few freckles about his nose he laughed as he finished reading the letter are you dave brower s boy he asked in a drawling falsetto looking at me out of grey eyes and smiling with good humour by adoption i answered he was an almighty good rassler he said deliberately as he looked again at the letter what do you want to do he asked abruptly want to work on the tribune i answered good lord he said i ca nt hire everybody i tried to think of some argument but what with looking at the great man before me and answering his questions and maintaining a decent show of dignity i had enough to do do you read the tribune he asked read it ever since i can remember what do you think of the administration lot of dough faces i answered smiling as i saw he recognised his own phrase he sat a moment tapping the desk with his penholder there s so many liars here in new york he said there ought to be room for an honest man how are the crops fair i answered big crop of boys every year and now you re trying to find a market he remarked want to have you try them i answered well said he very seriously turning to his desk that came up to his chin as he sat beside it go and write me an article about rats would you advise i started to say when he interrupted me the man that gives advice is a bigger fool than the man that takes it he fleered impatiently go and do your best before he had given me this injunction he had dipped his pen and begun to write hurriedly if i had known him longer i should have known that while he had been talking to me that tireless mind of his had summoned him to its service i went out in high spirits and sat down a moment on one of the benches in the little park near by to think it all over he was going to measure my judgement my skill as a writer my resources rats i said to myself thoughtfully had read much about them they infested the ships they overran the wharves they traversed the sewers an inspiration came to me i started for the waterfront asking my way every block or two near the east river i met a policeman a big husky good hearted irishman can you tell me i said who can give me information about rats rats he repeated what d ye wa nt know about thim everything i said they ve just given me a job on the new york tribune i added proudly he smiled good naturedly he had looked through me at a glance just say tribune he said ye do nt have t say new york tribune here come along wi me he took me to a dozen or more of the dock masters give im a lift my hearty he said to the first of them he s a green i have never forgotten the kindness of that irishman whom i came to know well in good time remembering that day and others i always greeted him with a hearty god bless the irish every time i passed him and he would answer amen an save yer riverince he did not leave me until i was on my way home loaded with fact and fable and good dialect with a savour of the sea in it hope and uncle eb were sitting together in his room when i returned guess i ve got a job i said trying to be very cool about it a job said hope eagerly as she rose where with mr horace greeley i answered my voice betraying my excitement jerusalem said uncle eb is it possible that s grand said hope tell us about it then i told them of my interview with the great editor and of what i had done since ye done wonderful said uncle eb and hope showed quite as much pleasure in her own sweet way i was for going to my room and beginning to write at once but hope said it was time to be getting ready for dinner when we came down at
chance at last to that only the answer of her eyes so sweet so full of sorrow he stooped above her his whole nature torn between love and doubt you hear me he said in low broken tones but you think yourself a traitor to listen and how could i not she cried with a sudden sob and then she found her speech her heart unveiled itself if i had never never come it is my fault that she is dying only only my fault and she turned away from him to hide her face and eyes against the rock in such an agony of feeling that he almost despaired he controlled himself sharply putting aside passion collecting his thoughts for dear life you are the most innocent the most true of tender friends it is in her name that i say to you lucy be kind lucy dare to love me she raised her arm suddenly and pointed to the ground between them there she said under her breath i see her there lying dead between us he was struck with horror realising in what a grip this sane and simple nature must feel itself before it could break into such expression what could he do or say he seated himself beside her he took her hands by force lucy i know what you mean i wo nt pretend that i do nt know you think that i ought to have married my cousin that if you had not been there i should have married her i might not yet but after some time it is quite true that it might have happened would it have made eleanor happy you saw me at the villa as i am you know well that even as a friend i constantly disappointed her there seemed to be a fate upon us which made me torment and wound her when i least intended it i do nt defend myself and heaven knows i do nt blame eleanor i have always believed that these things are mysterious predestined matters of temperament deeper than our will i was deeply sincerely attached to eleanor yet when you came after those first few weeks the falsity of the whole position flashed upon me and there was the book it seemed to me sometimes that the only way of extricating us all was to destroy the book and and all that it implied or might have been thought to imply he added hurriedly oh you need nt tell me that i was a blundering and selfish fool we have all got into a horrible coil and i ca nt pose before you if i would but it is nt eleanor that would hold you back from me lucy it is nt eleanor answer me you know that he held her almost roughly scanning her face in an agony that served him well her lips moved piteously in words that he could not hear but her hands lay passive in his grasp and he hastened on ever since that nemi evening lucy i have been a new creature i will tell you no lies i wo nt say that i never loved any woman before you i will have no secrets from you you shall know all if you want to know but i do say that every passion i ever knew in my first youth seems to me now a mere apprenticeship to loving you you have become my life my very heart if anything is to be made of a fellow like me it s you that ll give me a chance lucy oh my dear do nt turn from me it s eleanor s voice speaks in mine listen to us both her colour came and went she swayed towards him fascinated by his voice conquered by the mere exhaustion of her long struggle held in the grasp of that compulsion which eleanor had laid upon her manisty perceived her weakness his eyes flamed his arm closed round her i had an instinct a vision he said almost in her ear when i set out the day dawned on me like a day of consecration the sun was another sun the earth reborn i took up my pilgrimage again looking for lucy as i have looked for her the last six weeks and everything led me right the breeze and the woods and the birds they were all in league with me they pitied me they told me where lucy was the low rushing words ceased a moment manisty looked at her took both her hands again but they could nt tell me he murmured how to please her how to make her kind to me make her listen to me lucy whom shall i go to for that she turned away her face her hands released themselves manisty hardly breathed till she said with a trembling mouth and a little sob now and then between the words it is all so strange to me so strange and so so doubtful if there were only someone here from my own people someone who could advise me is it wise for you for us both you know i m so different from you and you ll find it out perhaps more and more and if you did and were discontented with me i ca nt be sure that i could always fit myself to you i was brought up so that that i ca nt always be as easy and pleasant as other girls my mother she stood by herself often and i with her she was a grand nature but i m sure you would have thought her extravagant and perhaps hard and often i feel as though i did nt know myself what there might be in me i know i m often very stubborn suppose in a few years her eyes came back to him searching and interrogating that bent look of his in
of seeing him one day in bronze and feeling that he is all mine for he has nt even that spark of luck which so often passes for infinitesimal greatness poor dear how did you guess that she had the taint in her asked betty as they were about to land she has not a suggestion of it in her face i felt it so vaguely that i scarcely put it in words to myself until lately and i never saw such an amount of pink on finger nails in my life vi betty went in search of harriet and found her in a summer house reading an innocuous french romance which her professor had selected there was no place near by where miss trumbull might lie concealed and betty went to the point at once harriet she said i am obliged to say something horribly painful if you want to marry any man you must tell him the truth it would be a crime not to the prejudices of of southerners are deep and bitter and and oh it is a terrible thing to have to say but i must if you had children they might be black for a moment betty thought that harriet was dead she turned so gray and her gaze was so fixed but she spoke in a moment why do you say this to me now because i fear you and jack oh i hope it is not true the person who thinks you love each other may have been mistaken but i could not wait to warn you i should have told you in the beginning that when the time came either you must tell the man or i should but it was a hateful subject god knows it is hard to speak now harriet seemed to have recovered herself the colour returned slowly to her face her heavy lids descended she rose and drew herself up to her full height with the air of complete melancholy which recalled one or two other memorable occasions but there was a subtle change the attitude did not seem so natural to her as formerly your informant was only half right she said sadly i love him but he cares nothing for me he is the best the kindest of friends it is no wonder that i love him i suppose i was bound to love the first man who treated me with affectionate respect i reckon i d have fallen in love with uncle if he d been younger perhaps in europe i may get over it but he does not love me betty rose and looked at her steadily what was in the brain behind those sad reproachful eyes she laid her hand on the girl s shoulder harriet she said solemnly give me your word of honour that you will not marry him without telling him the truth it may be that he does not love you but he might and if you were without hope you would be unhappy promise me down in the depths of those melancholy eyes there was a flash then harriet lifted her head and spoke with the solemnity of one taking an oath i promise she said i will marry no man without telling him the truth this time her tone carried conviction and betty relieved sought sally carter nonsense exclaimed miss carter when betty had related the interview he is in love with her although for some reason or other he is making an elaborate effort to conceal it she spoke very convincingly said betty who would not admit doubt anything with a drop of negro blood in it will lie it ca nt help it i wish the race were exterminated i wish the english had left it in africa they certainly saddled us with an everlasting curse she was tempted to wish that mr walker had never discovered her address but although she did not love harriet she was grateful still for the opportunity to rescue her from the usual fate of her breed but assuredly she did not wish her old friend to be sacrificed again she observed him closely and came to the conclusion that harriet had spoken the truth he was gayer than of old but his health was better and he was in cheerful company not living his days and nights in his lonely damp old house on the potomac river he appeared to enjoy talking to harriet but there was nothing lover like in his attitude and he was almost her guardian true he was occasionally moody and absent but a man must retain a few of his old spots and if he avoided somewhat the cousin whom he had once loved to melancholy it was doubtless because she found him as uninteresting as she found all men but one and was not at sufficient pains to conceal her indifference and then she admitted with a laugh that in the back of her mind she had never acknowledged the possibility of his loving another woman she but half admitted that she wished to believe no storm was gathering under her roof she had no desire to handle a tragedy vii it was saturday morning betty arose at four brewed herself a cup of coffee over a spirit lamp and ate several biscuit with it she hoped senator north would take the same precaution healthy animals when hungry cannot take much interest in each other she dressed herself in airy white with a blue ribbon in her hair there was no necessity for a hat at that hour in the morning but she took a white organdie one down to the boat and put it under a seat lest she be late in returning and the sun freckling it was faintly dawn as she pulled out into the middle of the lake and rowed toward its northern end even the trailing thickets on the water s edge looked black and
war in these leisurely beguilements the days passed until one morning attusah s fears and presentiments were realized in their seizure by a party of cherokees who swooped down upon their hermitage and bore them off by force to the council house of the town of citico where atta kulla kulla and a number of other head men had assembled to discuss the critical affairs of the tribe and decide on its future policy so critical indeed was the situation that it seemed to macvintie that they might well dispense with notice of two factors so inconsiderable in the scale of national importance as the ada wehi and his captive but one was a british prisoner calculated to expiate in a degree with his life the woe and ruin his comrades had wrought the more essential was this course since the triumph of putting him to the torture and death would gratify and reanimate many whose zeal was flagging under an accumulation of anguish and helpless defeat and stimulate them to renewed exertions for before the cherokees would sue for peace they waited long in the hope that the french would yet be enabled to convey to them a sufficient supply of powder to renew and prosecute the war as to the arrest of the other attusah of kanootare this was necessary in the event that submission to the british government became inevitable for since he claimed to be a ghost surely never was spectre so reckless he had indeed appeared to so many favored individuals that the english might fairly have cause to doubt his execution in satisfaction of his crimes against the government and the breach of faith on the part of the cherokee rulers in this conspicuous instance might well preclude the granting of any reasonable terms of peace now and subject the whole nation to added hardship this was the argument advanced by atta kulla kulla as he stood and addressed his colleagues who sat on buffalo skins in a circle on the floor of the council house of citico the usual dome shaped edifice daubed within and without with the rich red clay of the country and situated on a high artificial mound in the centre of the town the council fire alone gave light flashing upon the slender figure and animated face of this chief who although of slighter physique and lower stature than his compeers wielded by reason of his more intellectual qualities so potent an influence among them the oratorical gifts of atta kulla kulla had signally impressed europeans of culture and experience imagine then the effect on the raw young highland soldier hearing the flow of language watching the appropriate and forceful gestures noting the responsive sentiment in the fire lit countenances of the circle of feather crested indians yet comprehending little save that it was a masterpiece of cogent reasoning richly eloquent and that every word was as a fagot to the flames and a pang to the torture attusah of kanootare the northward warrior rose to reply in defense of himself and his captive and atta kulla kulla listened as courteously as the rest although the speech of the ada wehi depended like the oratory of many young men chiefly on a magical assurance he had an ally however in the dominant superstition of the cherokees numbers of the warriors now ascribed their recent disasters to the neglect of various omens or the omission of certain propitiatory observances of their ancient religion or the perpetration of deeds known to be adversely regarded by the ruling spirits of war moreover they were all aware that this man had been killed left for dead reported as dead to the british government which accepted the satisfaction thus offered for his crimes the deeds themselves however accounted by him and the rest of the tribe praiseworthy and the achievements of war and here he was protesting that he was dead and a ghost akee o hoosa akee o hoosa tsida wei yu he cried continually indeed this seemed to be the only reasonable method of accounting for the renewed presence in the world of a man known to be dead this was his status he argued he was a dead man and this was his captive the cherokee nation could not pretend to follow with its control the actions of a dead man they themselves had pronounced him dead he had no place in the war he had been forbidden on account of his official death to compete for the honors of the campaign apart from his former status as a cherokee merely as a supernatural being a spirit an ada wehi he had captured this british soldier who was therefore the property of a dead man and the cherokee law of all things and before all things forbade interference with the effects of the dead despite the curling contempt on the lip of atta kulla kulla the council did not immediately acquiesce in his view and thus for a time flattered the hope of the ada wehi that they were resting in suspension on the details of this choice argument there was an illogical inversion of values in the experience of the tribe and while they could not now accept the worthless figments of long ago it was not vouchsafed to them to enjoy the substantial merits of the new order of things reason powder diplomacy had brought the cherokee nation to a point of humiliation to which superstition savagery and the simplicities of the tomahawk had never descended in the good old times reason was never so befuddled of aspect civilization never so undesired as now in their own expanded outlook at life however they could not afford to ignore the views of atta kulla kulla the advocate of all the newer methods in so important a matter as the release of a british prisoner of war on the strange pretext that his captor was a ghost of a peculiar spectral
a leap like a mad thing the man was connor connor the boss of the loading gang the man who had seduced his wife who had sent him to prison and wrecked his home ruined his life he stood there staring with the light shining full upon him jurgis had often thought of connor since coming back to packingtown but it had been as of something far off that no longer concerned him now however when he saw him alive and in the flesh the same thing happened to him that had happened before a flood of rage boiled up in him a blind frenzy seized him and he flung himself at the man and smote him between the eyes and then as he fell seized him by the throat and began to pound his head upon the stones the woman began screaming and people came rushing in the lantern had been upset and extinguished and it was so dark they could not see a thing but they could hear jurgis panting and hear the thumping of his victim s skull and they rushed there and tried to pull him off precisely as before jurgis came away with a piece of his enemy s flesh between his teeth and as before he went on fighting with those who had interfered with him until a policeman had come and beaten him into insensibility and so jurgis spent the balance of the night in the stockyards station house this time however he had money in his pocket and when he came to his senses he could get something to drink and also a messenger to take word of his plight to bush harper harper did not appear however until after the prisoner feeling very weak and ill had been hailed into court and remanded at five hundred dollars bail to await the result of his victim s injuries jurgis was wild about this because a different magistrate had chanced to be on the bench and he had stated that he had never been arrested before and also that he had been attacked first and if only someone had been there to speak a good word for him he could have been let off at once but harper explained that he had been downtown and had not got the message what s happened to you he asked i ve been doing a fellow up said jurgis and i ve got to get five hundred dollars bail i can arrange that all right said the other though it may cost you a few dollars of course but what was the trouble it was a man that did me a mean trick once answered jurgis who is he he s a foreman in brown s or used to be his name s connor and the other gave a start connor he cried not phil connor yes said jurgis that s the fellow why good god exclaimed the other then you re in for it old man i ca nt help you not help me why not why he s one of scully s biggest men he s a member of the war whoop league and they talked of sending him to the legislature phil connor great heavens jurgis sat dumb with dismay why he can send you to joliet if he wants to declared the other ca nt i have scully get me off before he finds out about it asked jurgis at length but scully s out of town the other answered i do nt even know where he is he s run away to dodge the strike that was a pretty mess indeed poor jurgis sat half dazed his pull had run up against a bigger pull and he was down and out but what am i going to do he asked weakly how should i know said the other i should nt even dare to get bail for you why i might ruin myself for life again there was silence ca nt you do it for me jurgis asked and pretend that you did nt know who i d hit but what good would that do you when you came to stand trial asked harper then he sat buried in thought for a minute or two there s nothing unless it s this he said i could have your bail reduced and then if you had the money you could pay it and skip how much will it be jurgis asked after he had had this explained more in detail i do nt know said the other how much do you own i ve got about three hundred dollars was the answer well was harper s reply i m not sure but i ll try and get you off for that i ll take the risk for friendship s sake for i d hate to see you sent to state s prison for a year or two and so finally jurgis ripped out his bankbook which was sewed up in his trousers and signed an order which bush harper wrote for all the money to be paid out then the latter went and got it and hurried to the court and explained to the magistrate that jurgis was a decent fellow and a friend of scully s who had been attacked by a strike breaker so the bail was reduced to three hundred dollars and harper went on it himself he did not tell this to jurgis however nor did he tell him that when the time for trial came it would be an easy matter for him to avoid the forfeiting of the bail and pocket the three hundred dollars as his reward for the risk of offending mike scully all that he told jurgis was that he was now free and that the best thing he could do was to clear out as quickly as possible and so jurgis overwhelmed with gratitude and relief took the dollar and fourteen cents
even excited some compunction in the breast of benita what would his feelings be she wondered when he found that they had run away leaving him to deal with their joint undertaking single handed almost was she minded to tell him the whole truth yet and this was a curious evidence of the man s ascendancy over her she did not perhaps she felt that to do so would be to put an end to their scheme since then by argument blandishments threats force or appeal to their sense of loyalty it mattered not which he would bring about its abandonment but she wanted to fulfil that scheme to be free of bambatse its immemorial ruins its graveyard cave and the ghoul jacob meyer who could delve among dead bones and in living hearts with equal skill and insight and yet was unable to find the treasure that lay beneath either of them so they hid the truth and talked with feverish activity about other things such as the drilling of the makalanga and the chances of an attack by the matabele which happily now seemed to be growing small also of the conditions of their cattle and the prospect of obtaining more to replace those that had died indeed benita went farther in her new found zeal of deception she proceeded to act a lie yes even with her father s reproachful eyes fixed upon her incidentally she mentioned that they were going to have an outing to climb down the ladder and visit the makalanga camp between the first and second walls and mix with the great world for a few hours also to carry their washing to be done there and bring up some clean clothes and certain books which she had left below jacob came out of his thoughts and calculations and listened gloomily i have half a mind to come with you he said words at which benita shivered it certainly is most cursed lonesome in that cave and i seem to hear things in it as though those old bones were rattling sounds like sighs and whispers too which are made by the draught well why do nt you asked benita it was a bold stroke but it succeeded if he had any doubts they vanished and he answered at once because i have not the time we have to get this business finished one way or another before the wet season comes on and we are drowned out of the place with rain or rotted by fever take your afternoon out miss clifford every maid of all work is entitled to as much and i am afraid that is your billet here only he added with that care for her safety which he always showed in his more temperate moods pray be careful clifford to get back before sundown that wall is too risky for your daughter to climb in the dusk call me from the foot of it you have the whistle and i will come down to help her up i think i ll go with you after all no i wo nt i made myself so unpleasant to them yesterday that those makalanga ca nt wish to see any more of me at present i hope you will have a more agreeable afternoon than i shall why do nt you take a ride outside the wall your horses are fat and want exercise and i do not think that you need be afraid of the matabele then without waiting for an answer he rose and left them mr clifford looked after him doubtfully oh i know said benita it seems horribly mean but one must do shabby things sometimes here are the bundles all ready so let us be off accordingly they went and from the top of the wall benita glanced back to bid goodbye to that place which she hoped never to see again yet she could not feel as though she looked her last upon it to her it wore no air of farewell and even as she descended the perilous stairs she found herself making mental notes as to how they might best be climbed again also she could not believe that she had done with mr meyer it seemed to her as though for a long while yet her future would be full of him they reached the outer fortifications in safety and there were greeted with some surprise but with no displeasure by the makalanga whom they found still drilling with the rifles in the use of which a certain number of them appeared to have become fairly proficient going to the hut in which the spare goods from the waggon had been stored they quickly made their preparations here also mr clifford wrote a letter one of the most unpleasant that he had ever been called upon to compose it ran thus dear meyer i do nt know what you will think of us but we are escaping from this place the truth is that i am not well and my daughter can bear it no longer she says that if she stops here she will die and that hunting for treasure in that ghastly grave yard is shattering her nerves i should have liked to tell you but she begged me not being convinced that if i did you would over persuade us or stop us in some way as for the gold if you can find it take it all i renounce my share we are leaving you the waggon and the

good fortune yours sincerely and with much regret t clifford the letter written they saddled the horses which had been brought up for their inspection and were found to be in
me and a glimmer of hope it might not have made any difference but i wish to god i had known it before drew could not stand the misery of the convulsed face he turned his eyes away drew filmer had risen suddenly and now confronted his companion with deep flashing eyes drew i m not going to take the fortune unless i m fit to handle it i ve been a tramp long enough to know that i can keep on being a tramp but i m going to make one more almighty try before i succumb i may be all wrong but lately i ve thought the the motive power has come to me a strange uplifting dignity seemed to fall upon filmer drew tried to speak to say the right thing but he merely smiled feebly and rose unsteadily to his feet i would nt blame you if you cut me after this drew but it s got to be said it s your sister my sister connie drew was never so surprised and astounded in his life before connie he gasped again connie if if i was what i might be if i come into my own drew do you think she could care for me how under heaven can i tell drew said slowly she has never how could she shown he paused how indeed could she filmer laughed a hard bitter laugh it would be a poor sort of reformation jock drew was getting command of himself if it were only to get her you ve got to get yourself old man before you d dare ask any woman to care for you i often think the best of us ask a good deal on trust but at least a man must know himself before he has a right to expect even faith oh i ve worked all that out drew i ve been to hillcrest to talk the beginnings over with a little lawyer fellow who s had my confidence all along i m going back where i fell drew in the start i m going back there where the loss of her the mother s laugh and song will grip the hardest and where the antidote will be the easiest to get i m going to take only enough of the governor s money to keep me out of the filth of the gutter until i can climb on to the curb or go to the sewer see but always there is going to be your sister above me just remember that and if you can help her to think of me once in a while filmer until you climb up you must not ask me to hold even one thought of my sister s for you except and here drew looked frankly in the anxious face except as the good fellow of our solitude thank you that s all i meant and if i pull up and stay up she not i will know how to use the money she s got the heart that can reach down to the suffering and hold little dying kids on her breast if i go under drew the money is going to her anyway filmer that s all right drew i know what i m about she ll brighten up all the dark places and remember me in that way if in no other long the two men looked at each other then drew extended his hand jock took it in a firm grip good night filmer and god be with you i m ready to start i ll tramp back with you as far as the bungalow jock dashed the crumbling glowing logs with his foot and left the fire dying but safe then gathering his travelling things together he went out with drew closing the door behind him it was a snowy night now white and dry in silence the two trudged on to the bungalow then drew said and you wo nt come in filmer just for a word thanks no where are you going now to hillcrest i start from there to morrow morning after another talk with the little fellow i mentioned i m going to keep to the woods for a few days they always brace me then i m going to make a break for the coast you ll write to me jock for a moment filmer hesitated then he said eagerly yes as long as i m fighting i ll keep in touch if i get down you ll know by my not writing and drew i want to tell you something that religion of yours is all right it was the first kind that ever got into my system and stayed there it s got iron red hot iron in it but it s got a homelike kind of friendliness about it that gives you heart to hope in this life and let the next life take care of itself thank you filmer that s going to make me fight another quick strong handclasp and then drew turned toward the glowing windows of his home filmer stood with uncovered head in the driving storm and looked with a great hungry craving up to the house that held the motive power of his new life and then with a dull pain he grimly set his face toward the coast chapter xix drew waited until after christmas before he took a decided part in the affairs of gaston and joyce indeed he purposely avoided any information regarding what was going on at the shack among the pines he was determined that st ange s first true christmas should be as far as he could make it a perfect one and it was one never to be forgotten it set a high standard one from which the place was never again to fall far below the snowstorm raged furiously for hours and then the weather cleared suddenly and
only marco knew this he said to loristan with appeal in his voice it was he who invented the game said loristan i showed you his strange maps and plans it is a good game the prince answered in the manner of a man extraordinarily interested and impressed they know it well they can be trusted no such thing has ever been done before loristan said it is as new as it is daring and simple therein lies its safety the prince answered perhaps only boyhood said loristan could have dared to imagine it the prince thanks you he said after a few more words spoken aside to his visitor we both thank you you may go back to your beds and the boys went xix that is one a week had not passed before marco brought to the rat in their bedroom an envelope containing a number of slips of paper on each of which was written something this is another part of the game he said gravely let us sit down together by the table and study it they sat down and examined what was written on the slips at the head of each was the name of one of the places with which marco had connected a face he had sketched below were clear and concise directions as to how it was to be reached and the words to be said when each individual was encountered this person is to be found at his stall in the market was written of the vacant faced peasant you will first attract his attention by asking the price of something when he is looking at you touch your left thumb lightly with the forefinger of your right hand then utter in a low distinct tone the words the lamp is lighted that is all you are to do sometimes the directions were not quite so simple but they were all instructions of the same order the originals of the sketches were to be sought out always with precaution which should conceal that they were being sought at all and always in such a manner as would cause an encounter to appear to be mere chance then certain words were to be uttered but always without attracting the attention of any bystander or passer by the boys worked at their task through the entire day they concentrated all their powers upon it they wrote and re wrote they repeated to each other what they committed to memory as if it were a lesson marco worked with the greater ease and more rapidly because exercise of this order had been his practice and entertainment from his babyhood the rat however almost kept pace with him as he had been born with a phenomenal memory and his eagerness and desire were a fury but throughout the entire day neither of them once referred to what they were doing as anything but the game at night it is true each found himself lying awake and thinking it was the rat who broke the silence from his sofa it is what the messengers of the secret party would be ordered to do when they were sent out to give the sign for the rising he said i made that up the first day i invented the party did nt i yes answered marco after a third day s concentration they knew by heart everything given to them to learn that night loristan put them through an examination can you write these things he asked after each had repeated them and emerged safely from all cross questioning each boy wrote them correctly from memory write yours in french in german in russian in samavian loristan said to marco all you have told me to do and to learn is part of myself father marco said in the end it is part of me as if it were my hand or my eyes or my heart i believe that is true answered loristan he was pale that night and there was a shadow on his face his eyes held a great longing as they rested on marco it was a yearning which had a sort of dread in it lazarus also did not seem quite himself he was red instead of pale and his movements were uncertain and restless he cleared his throat nervously at intervals and more than once left his chair as if to look for something it was almost midnight when loristan standing near marco put his arm round his shoulders the game he began and then was silent a few moments while marco felt his arm tighten its hold both marco and the rat felt a hard quick beat in their breasts and because of this and because the pause seemed long marco spoke the game yes father he said the game is about to give you work to do both of you loristan answered lazarus cleared his throat and walked to the easel in the corner of the room but he only changed the position of a piece of drawing paper on it and then came back in two days you are to go to paris as you to the rat planned in the game as i planned the rat barely breathed the words yes answered loristan the instructions you have learned you will carry out there is no more to be done than to manage to approach certain persons closely enough to be able to utter certain words to them only two young strollers whom no man could suspect put in lazarus in an astonishingly rough and shaky voice they could pass near the emperor himself without danger the young master his voice became so hoarse that he was obligated to clear it loudly the young master must carry himself less finely it would be well to shuffle a little and slouch as if he were of the common people yes said the rat hastily he must do that i can
voices were lost in the general shouting wonderful said doris at last looking up from the last of these epistles i really did nt know arthur you were such a great man her eyes rested on him with a fond but rather puzzled expression well of course dear you ve always seen the seamy side of me said meadows with the slightest change of tone and a laugh perhaps now you ll believe me when i say that i m not always lazy when i seem so that a man must have time to think and smoke and dawdle if he s to write anything decent and ca nt always rush at the first job that offers when you thought i was idling i was nt i was gathering up impressions then came an attractive piece of work one that suited me and i rose to it there you see he threw back his jovian head with a look at his wife half combative half merry doris s forehead puckered a little well thank heaven that it has turned out well she said with a deep breath where we should have been if it had nt i m sure i do nt know and as it is by the way arthur have you got that packet ready for new york her tone was quick and anxious what the proofs of dizzy oh goodness that ll do any time do nt bother doris i m really rather done and this post is well upon my word it s overwhelming and gathering up the letters he threw himself with an air of fatigue into a long chair his hands behind his head perhaps after tea and a cigarette i shall feel more fit arthur you know to morrow is the last day for catching the new york mail well hang it if i do nt catch it they must wait that s all said meadows peevishly if they wo nt take it somebody else will they represented the editor and publisher of a famous new york magazine who had agreed by cable to give a large sum for the dizzy lecture provided it reached them by a certain date doris twisted her lip arthur do think of the bills darling do nt be a nuisance if i succeed i shall make money and if this is nt a success i do nt know what is he pointed to the letters on his lap an impatient gesture which dislodged a certain number of them so that they came rustling to the floor hullo here s one you have nt opened another coronet gracious i believe it s the woman who asked us to dinner a fortnight ago and we could nt go meadows sat up with a jerk all languor dispelled and held out his hand for the letter lady dunstable by george i thought she d ask us though you do nt deserve it doris for you did nt take any trouble at all about her first invitation we were engaged cried doris interrupting him her eyebrows mounting we could have got out of it perfectly but now listen to this dear mr meadows i hope your wife will excuse my writing to you instead of to her as you and i are already acquainted can i induce you both to come to crosby ledgers for a week end on july we hope to have a pleasant party a diplomat or two the home secretary and general hichen perhaps some others you would i am sure admire our hill country and i should like to show you some of the precious autographs we have inherited yours sincerely rachel dunstable if your wife brings a maid perhaps she will kindly let me know doris laughed and the amused scorn of her laugh annoyed her husband however at that moment their small house parlourmaid entered with the tea tray and doris rose to make a place for it the parlourmaid put it down with much unnecessary noise and doris looking at her in alarm saw that her expression was sulky and her eyes red when the girl had departed mrs meadows said with resignation there that one will give me notice to morrow well i m sure you could easily get a better said her husband sharply doris shook her head the fourth in six months she said sighing and she really is a good girl i suppose as usual she complains of me the voice was that of an injured man yes dear she does they all do you give them a lot of extra work already and all these things you have been buying lately oh arthur if you would nt buy things mean more work you know that copper coal scuttle you sent in yesterday well is nt it a beauty a real georgian piece cried meadows indignantly i dare say it is but it has to be cleaned when it arrived jane came to see me in this room shut the door and put her back against it there s another of them beastly copper coal scuttles come you should have seen her eyes blazing and i should like to know ma am who s going to clean it cos i ca nt and i just had to promise her it might go dirty lazy minx said meadows good humouredly with his mouth full of tea cake at last i have something good to look at in this room he turned his eyes caressingly towards the new coal scuttle i suppose i shall have to clean it myself doris laughed again this time almost hysterically but was checked by a fresh entrance of jane who with an air of defiance deposited a heavy parcel on a chair beside her mistress and flounced out again what is this said doris in consternation books more books heavens arthur what have you been ordering now i could nt sleep last night for thinking
all than rousseau s plan of educating emile which certainly obtained a wide hearing and considerable support in its time no tempting as it would be it would be difficult to carry out such a theory in these days of logic and common sense and in some moment of weakness i might possibly succumb and tell her all about it for fear that some stranger whom she might meet at a ball would have the pleasure of doing it first the next best woman person in the world with whom to see venice barring the lovely non existent daughter is salemina it is our first visit but alas we are nevertheless much better informed than i could wish salemina s mind is particularly well furnished but luckily she cannot always remember the point wished for at the precise moment of need so that taking her all in all she is nearly as agreeable as if she were ignorant her knowledge never bulks heavily and insistently in the foreground or middle distance like that of miss celia van tyck but remains as it should in the haze of a melting and delicious perspective she has plenty of enthusiasms too and miss van tyck has none imagine our plight at being accidentally linked to that encyclopaedic lady in italy she is an old acquaintance of salemina s and joined us in florence where she had been staying for a month waiting for her niece kitty schuyler kitty copley now who is in spain with her husband miss van tyck would be endurable in sheffield glasgow lyons genoa kansas city pompeii or pittsburg but she should never have blighted venice with her presence she insisted however on accompanying us and i can only hope that the climate and associations will have a relaxing effect on her habits of thought and speech when she was in florence she was so busy in reading up verona and padua that she had no time for the uffizi gallery in verona and padua she was absorbed in hare s venice vaccinating herself so to speak with information that it might not steal upon and infect her unawares if there is anything that miss van abhors it is knowing a thing without knowing that she knows it while for me the most charming knowledge is the sort that comes by unconscious absorption like the free grace of god we intended to enter venice in orthodox fashion by moonlight and began to consult about trains when we were in milan the porter said that there was only one train between the eight and the twelve and gave me a pamphlet on the subject but salemina objects to an early start and miss van refuses to arrive anywhere after dusk so it is fortunate that the distances are not great they have a curious way of reckoning time in italy for i found that the train leaving milan at eight thirty was scheduled to arrive at ten minutes past eighteen you could never sit up until then miss van i said but on the other hand if we leave later to please salemina say at ten in the morning we do not arrive until eight minutes before twenty one i have nt the faintest idea what time that will really be but it sounds too late for three defenceless women all of them unmarried to be prowling about in a strange city it proved on investigation however that twenty one o clock is only nine in christian language that is one s mother tongue so we united in choosing that hour as being the most romantic possible and there was a full yellow moon as we arrived in the railway station my heart beat high with joy and excitement for i succeeded in establishing miss van with salemina in one gondola while i took all the luggage in another ridding myself thus cleverly of the disenchanting influence of miss van s company do come with us penelope she said as we issued from the portico of the station and heard instead of the usual cab drivers pandemonium only the soft lapping of waves against the marble steps do come with us penelope and let us enter dangerous and sweet charmed venice together it does indeed look a veritable sea bird s nest she had informed me before in milan that cassiodorus theodoric s secretary had thus styled venice but somehow her slightest remark is out of key i can always see it printed in small type in a footnote at the bottom of the page and i always wish to skip it as i do other footnotes and annotations and marginal notes and addenda if miss van s mother had only thought of it addenda would have been a delightful christian name for her and much more appropriate than celia if i should be asked on bended knees if i should be reminded that every intelligent and sympathetic creature brings a pair of fresh eyes to the study of the beautiful if it should be affirmed that the new note is as likely to be struck by the prentice as by the master hand if i should be assured that my diary would never be read i should still refuse to write my first impressions of venice my best successes in life have been achieved by knowing what not to do and i consider it the finest common sense to step modestly along in beaten paths not stirring up even there any more dust than is necessary if my friends and acquaintances ever go to venice let them read their ruskin their goethe their byron shelley and wordsworth their rogers gautier michelet their symonds and howells not forgetting old coryat s crudities and be thankful i spared them mine it was the eve of ascension day and a yellow may moon was hanging in the blue i wished with all my heart that it were a little matter of seven
extending as far as her eye could reach she saw bits of forest verdure clothed hills fields of waving grain fountains rivers and lakes and throughout the scene were scattered groups of pretty houses and a few grand castles and palaces over all this delightful landscape which from trot s high perch seemed like a magnificent painted picture was a rosy glow such as we sometimes see in the west at sunset in this case however it was not in the west only but everywhere no wonder the ork paused to circle slowly over this lovely country the other birds followed his action all eyeing the place with equal delight then as with one accord the four formed a group and slowly sailed downward this brought them to that part of the newly discovered land which bordered on the desert s edge but it was just as pretty here as anywhere so the ork and the birds alighted and the three passengers at once got out of their swings oh cap n bill is nt this fine an dandy exclaimed trot rapturously how lucky we were to discover this beautiful country the country seems rather high class i ll admit trot replied the old sailor man looking around him but we do nt know as yet what its people are like no one could live in such a country without being happy and good i m sure of that she said earnestly do nt you think so button bright i m not thinking just now answered the little boy it tires me to think and i never seem to gain anything by it when we see the people who live here we will know what they are like and no mount of thinking will make them any different that s true enough said the ork but now i want to make a proposal while you are getting acquainted with this new country which looks as if it contains everything to make one happy i would like to fly along all by myself and see if i can find my home on the other side of the great desert if i do i will stay there of course but if i fail to find orkland i will return to you in a week to see if i can do anything more to assist you they were sorry to lose their queer companion but could offer no objection to the plan so the ork bade them good bye and rising swiftly in the air he flew over the country and was soon lost to view in the distance the three birds which had carried our friends now begged permission to return by the way they had come to their own homes saying they were anxious to show their families how big they had become so cap n bill and trot and button bright all thanked them gratefully for their assistance and soon the birds began their long flight toward the land of mo being now left to themselves in this strange land the three comrades selected a pretty pathway and began walking along it they believed this path would lead them to a splendid castle which they espied in the distance the turrets of which towered far above the tops of the trees which surrounded it it did not seem very far away so they sauntered on slowly admiring the beautiful ferns and flowers that lined the pathway and listening to the singing of the birds and the soft chirping of the grasshoppers presently the path wound over a little hill in a valley that lay beyond the hill was a tiny cottage surrounded by flower beds and fruit trees on the shady porch of the cottage they saw as they approached a pleasant faced woman sitting amidst a group of children to whom she was telling stories the children quickly discovered the strangers and ran toward them with exclamations of astonishment so that trot and her friends became the center of a curious group all chattering excitedly cap n bill s wooden leg seemed to arouse the wonder of the children as they could not understand why he had not two meat legs this attention seemed to please the old sailor who patted the heads of the children kindly and then raising his hat to the woman he inquired can you tell us madam just what country this is she stared hard at all three of the strangers as she replied briefly jinxland oh exclaimed cap n bill with a puzzled look and where is jinxland please in the quadling country said she what cried trot in sudden excitement do you mean to say this is the quadling country of the land of oz to be sure i do the woman answered every bit of land that is surrounded by the great desert is the land of oz as you ought to know as well as i do but i m sorry to say that jinxland is separated from the rest of the quadling country by that row of high mountains you see yonder which have such steep sides that no one can cross them so we live here all by ourselves and are ruled by our own king instead of by ozma of oz i ve been to the land of oz before said button bright but i ve never been here did you ever hear of jinxland before asked trot no said button bright it is on the map of oz though asserted the woman and it s a fine country i assure you if only she added and then paused to look around her with a frightened expression if only here she stopped again as if not daring to go on with her speech if only what ma am asked cap n bill the woman sent the children into the house then she came closer to the strangers and whispered if only we had a different king we
but still quite tolerable ewen hooper he vowed was a magnificent scholar and it was too bad that oxford had found nothing better for him than a scrubby readership but some day of course he ll have the regius professorship nora was a plucky little thing though she hates me and he falloden was not so sure after all that miss alice would not land her pryce ca nt we bring it about and falloden ran laughing through a catalogue of his own smart or powerful relations speculating what could be done it was true was nt it that pryce was anxious to turn his back on oxford and the higher mathematics and to try his luck in journalism or politics well falloden happened to know that an attractive post in the conservative central office would soon be vacant an uncle of his was a very important person on the council that and other wires might be pulled constance eagerly began to count up her own opportunities of the same kind and between them they had soon in imagination captured the post then said falloden it would be for constance to clinch the matter no man could do such a thing decently pryce would have to be told the world s your oyster but before you open it you will kindly go and propose to my cousin which of course you ought to have done months ago and so laughing and plotting like a couple of children they had gone rambling through the green rides and glades of the wood occasionally putting their horses to the gallop that the pulse of life might run still faster but a later topic of conversation had brought them into even closer contact connie spoke of her proposed visit to her aunts falloden radiant could not conceal his delight you will be only five miles from us of course you must come and stay at flood my mother writes they have collected a jolly party for the th i will tell her to write to you at once you must come you must will you promise and constance wondering at her own docility had practically promised i want you to know my people i want you to know my father and as he plunged again into talk about his father the egotistical man of fashion disappeared she seemed at last to have reached something sincere and soft and true and then what had begun the jarring was it first her account of her greek lessons with sorell before she knew what had happened the brow beside her had clouded the voice had changed why did she see so much of sorell he like radowitz was a poseur a wind bag that was what made the attraction between them if she wished to learn greek let me teach you and he had bent forward with his most brilliant and imperious look his hand upon her reins but constance surprised and ruffled had protested that sorell had been her mother s dear friend and was now her own she could not and would not give up her lessons why indeed should she because friends falloden had laid a passionate emphasis on the word must have some regard surely to each other s likes and dislikes if you have an enemy tell me he or she shall be mine instantly sorell dislikes me you will never hear any good of me from him and of course radowitz hates me i have given him good cause promise at least that you will not dance with radowitz again you do nt know what i suffered last night he has the antics of a monkey whereupon the quarrel between them had broken like thunder constance denouncing the arrogance and unkindness that could ask such promises of her falloden steadily and with increasing bitterness pressing his demand and so to the last scene between them at the gate was it a breach or would it all be made up that very night at the magdalen ball no it was and should be a breach constance fought back her tears and rode proudly home what are you going to wear to night said nora putting her head in at constance s door constance was lying down by annette s strict command in preparation for her second ball which was being given by magdalen where the college was reported to have surpassed itself in the lavishness of all the preparations made for lighting up its beautiful walks and quadrangles constance pointed languidly to the sofa where a creation in white silk and tulle just arrived from london had been laid out by the reverential hands of annette why on earth does one go to balls said constance gloomily pressing both hands upon a pair of aching temples nora shut the door behind her and came to the side of the bed it s time to dress she said firmly alice says you had a succs fou last night go away and do nt talk nonsense constance turned on her side and shut her eyes oh alice had nt a bad time either said nora complacently sitting on the bed herbert pryce seems to have behaved quite decently shall i tell you something the laughing girl stooped over connie and said in her ear now that herbert knows it would be no good proposing to you he thinks it might be a useful thing to have you for a relation do nt be horrid said constance if i were alice you d punch my head nora laughed all very well but alice does nt much care why herbert pryce marries her so long as he does marry her constance did not reply she continued to feign a headache but all the time she was thinking of the scene in the wood that morning when she and falloden had to amuse themselves plotted the rise in life and the matrimonial happiness of herbert and alice
or so you will see that the window shades are drawn and the door closed and that no one disturbs the man while he is copying those returns which he will be sure to do colonel irons i depend upon you to see to it that he has an opportunity to escape safely with his budget i warn you not to let him fail it is most important the next morning weatherly was ordered to report to major binkus for training in scout duty and the morning after that he was taken out through the lines mounted with colonel irons and carefully lost in the pine bush he was seen no more in the american camp the spy delivered his report to the british and the little remnant of an army at morristown was safe for the winter cornwallis and howe put such confidence in this report that when luce another spy came into their camp with a count of washington s forces which was substantially correct they doubted the good faith of the man and threw him into prison so the great virginian had turned a british spy into one of his most effective helpers meanwhile good news had encouraged enlistment for long terms four regiments of horse were put in training ten frigates were built and sent to sea and more were under construction the whole fighting force of america was being reorganized moreover in this first year the yankee privateers had so wounded a leg of the british lion that he was roaring with rage three hundred and fifty of his ships well laden from the west indies had been seized their cargoes were valued at a million pounds the fighting spirit of america was encouraged also by events in france where franklin and silas deane were now at work france had become an ally a loan of six hundred thousand dollars had been secured in the french capital and expert officers from that country had begun to arrive to join the army of washington chapter xviii how solomon shifted the skeer in the spring news came of a great force of british which was being organized in canada for a descent upon new york through lake champlain frontier settlers in tryon county were being massacred by indians generals herkimer and schuyler had written to washington asking for the services of the famous scout solomon binkus in that region he knows the indian as no other man knows him and can speak his language and he also knows the bush schuyler had written if there is any place on earth where his help is needed just now it is here got to leave ye my son solomon said to jack one evening soon after that how so the young man asked goin hum to fight injuns the great father has ordered it i ll like it better gittin lazy here summer s comin an i m a born bush man i m kind o oneasy like a deer in a dooryard i ai nt had to run fer my life since we got here my hoofs are complainin i ai nt shot a gun in a month a look of sorrow spread over the face of solomon i m tired of this place said jack the british are scared of us and we re scared of the british there s nothing going on i d love to go back to the big bush with you i ll tell the great father that you re a born bush man mebbe he ll let ye go they ll need us both rum injuns an the devil have j ined hands the long house will be the center o hell an its line fences ll take in the hull big bush that day jack s name was included in the order i am sorry that it is not yet possible to pay you or any of the men who have served me so faithfully said washington if you need money i shall be glad to lend you a sum to help you through this journey i ai nt fightin fer pay solomon answered i ll hoe an dig an cook an guide fer money but i wo nt fight no more fer money partly cause i do nt need it partly cause i m fightin fer myself i got a little left in my britches pocket but if i had nt my ol marier would nt let me go hungry in april the two friends set out afoot for the lower end of the highlands on the river they hired a dutch farmer to take them on to albany in his sloop after two delightful days at home general schuyler suggested that they could do a great service by traversing the wilderness to the valley of the great river of the north as far as possible toward swegachie and reporting their observations to crown point or fort edward if there seemed to be occasion for it and if not they were to proceed to general herkimer s camp at oriskany and give him what help they could in protecting the settlers in the west you would need to take all your wit and courage with you the general warned them the indians are in bad temper they have taken to roasting their prisoners at the stake and eating their flesh this is a hazardous undertaking therefore i give you a suggestion and not an order i ll go lone said solomon if i get et up it need nt break nobody s heart let jack go to one o the forts no i d rather go into the bush with you said jack we re both needed there if necessary we could separate and carry our warning in two directions we ll take a couple of the new double barreled rifles and four pistols if we had to i think we could fight a hole through any trouble we are
manufacture a decent thick surface of conventionality and its self conscious respectable wing could no more escape its spirit than its fogs and winds but evil excitement was tempered to irresponsible gaiety a constant whirl of innocent pleasures when the spirit passed the portals untempered and drove women too highly strung too unhappy or too easily bored to the divorce courts to drink or to reckless adventure they were summarily dropped no woman however guiltless could divorce her husband and remain a member of that vigilant court it was all or nothing if a married woman were clever enough to take a lover undetected and merely furnish interesting surmise there was no attempt to ferret out and punish her for no society can exist without gossip but none centered about madeleine talbot her little coquetries were impartial and her devotion to her husband was patent to the most infatuated eye life was made very pleasant for her howard during that first winter accompanied her to

dr talbot rarely left his post for even a few days shooting and madeleine remained with him as a matter of course moreover she hoped for occasional long evenings with her husband and the opportunity to convince him that her companionship was more satisfying than that of his friends at the club she had not renounced the design of gradually converting him to her own love of literature and pictured delightful hours during which they would discuss the world s masterpieces together but he merely hooted amiably and pinched her cheeks when she approached the subject tentatively he was infernally over worked and unless he had a few hours relaxation at the club he would be unfit for duty on the morrow she was his heart s delight the prettiest wife in san francisco he worked the better because she was always lovely at the breakfast table and he could look forward to a brief dinner in her always radiant company thank god she never had the blues nor carried a bottle of smelling salts about with her and she had nt a nerve in her body god how he did hate women s nerves no she was a model wife and he adored her unceasingly but companionship when she timidly uttered the word he first stared uncomprehendingly then burst into loud laughter men do nt find companionship in women my dear if they pretend to they re after something else take the word of an old stager for that of course there is no such thing as companionship among women as men understand the term but you have society which is really all you want yearnings are merely a symptom of those accursed nerves for god s sake forget them flirt all you choose there are plenty of men in town have them in for dinner if you like but if any of those young bucks talks companionship to you put up your guard or come and tell me i ll settle his hash i do nt want the companionship of any other man but i d like yours you do nt know how lucky you are you have all of me you could stand three or four long evenings well we d yawn in each other s faces and go to bed a bull but true enough then i think i ll have the books unpacked not only those i brought but the new case papa sent to me i have lost the resource of society for several months and i do not care to have men here after you have gone that would mean gossip you are above gossip and i prefer the men to the books you ll ruin your pretty eyes and you had the makings of a fine bluestocking when i rescued you a successful woman with her husband and with society has only sparkling shallows in her pretty little head now i must run i really should nt have come all the way up here for lunch madeleine wandered aimlessly to the window and looked down at the scurrying throngs on montgomery street there were few women the men bent against the wind clutching at their hats or chasing them along the uneven wooden sidewalks tripping perhaps on a loose board there were tiny whirlwinds of dust in the unpaved streets the bustling little city that madeleine had thought so picturesque in its novelty suddenly lost its glamour it looked as if parts of it had been flung together in a night between solid blocks imported from the older communities so furious was the desire to achieve immediate wealth there were only three or four buildings of architectural beauty in the city the shop windows on montgomery street were attractive with the wares of paris but madeleine coveted nothing in san francisco she thought of boston new york washington europe and for a moment nostalgia overwhelmed her if howard would only take her home
now but if he s on earth he ll face me sometime unable to control himself further banion wheeled and galloped away to his own train you ask if we re to join in with the yankees he flared out to jackson no we ll camp apart and train apart i wo nt go on with them well said the scout i did nt never think we would er believe ye could not till they git in trouble agin er till a certain light wagon an mules throws in with us huh you ll say no more of that jackson but one thing you and i have got to ride and see if we can get any trace of woodhull like looking for a needle in a haystack an a damn bad needle at that was the old man s comment chapter xvi the plains on to the platte the buffalo new cheer seemed to come to the hearts of the emigrants now and they forgot bickering the main train ground grimly ahead getting back if not all its egotism at least more and more of its self reliance by courtesy wingate still rode ahead though orders came now from a joint council of his leaders since banion would not take charge the great road to oregon was even now not a trail but a road deep cut into the soil though no wheeled traffic had marked it until within the past five years a score of paralled paths it might be at times of tentative location along a hillside or a marshy level but it was for the most part a deep cut unmistakable road from which it had been impossible to wander at times it lay worn into the sod a half foot a foot in depth sometimes it followed the ancient buffalo trails to water the first roads of the far west quickly seized on by hunters and engineers or again it transected these hanging to the ridges after frontier road fashion heading out for the proved fords of the greater streams always the wheel marks of those who had gone ahead in previous years the continuing thread of the trail itself worn in by trader and trapper and mormon and oregon or california man gave hope and cheer to these who followed with the plow stretching out closing up almost inch by inch like some giant measuring worm in its slow progress the train held on through a vast and stately landscape which some travelers had called the eden of america such effect was given by the series of altering scenes small imagination indeed was needed to picture here a long established civilization although there was not a habitation they were beyond organized society and beyond the law game became more abundant wild turkeys still appeared in the timbered creek bottoms many elk were seen more deer and very many antelope packed in northward by the fires a number of panthers and giant gray wolves beyond counting kept the hunters always excited the wild abundance of an unexhausted nature offered at every hand the sufficiency of life brought daily growth in the self reliance which had left them for a time the wide timberlands the broken low hills of the green prairie at length began to give place to a steadily rising inclined plane the soil became less black and heavy with more sandy ridges the oak and hickory stout trees of their forefathers passed and the cottonwoods appeared after they had crossed the ford of the big blue a hundred yards of racing water they passed what is now the line between kansas and nebraska and followed up the little blue beyond whose ford the trail left these quieter river valleys and headed out over a high table land in a keen straight flight over the great valley of the platte the highway to the rockies now the soil was sandier the grass changed yet again they had rolled under wheel by now more than one hundred different varieties of wild grasses the vegetation began to show the growing altitude the cactus was seen now and then on the far horizon the wavering mysteries of the mirage appeared marvelous in deceptiveness mystical alluring the very spirits of the far west appearing to move before their eyes in giant pantomime they were passing from the prairies to the plains shouts and cheers arose as the word passed back that the sand hills known as the coasts of the platte were in sight some mothers told their children they were now almost to oregon the whips cracked more loudly the tired teams tongues lolling quickened their pace as they struck the down grade gap leading through the sand ridges two thousand americans some of them illiterate and ignorant all of them strong taking with them law order society the church the school anew were staging the great drama of human life act and scene and episode as though upon some great moving platform drawn by invisible cables beyond the vast proscenium of the hills chapter xvii the great encampment as the long columns of the great wagon train broke through the screening sand hills there was disclosed a vast and splendid panorama the valley of the platte lay miles wide green in the full covering of spring a crooked and broken thread of timber growth appeared marking the moister soil and outlining the general course of the shallow stream whose giant cottonwoods were dwarfed now by the distances in between and for miles up and down the flat expanse there rose the blue smokes of countless camp fires each showing the location of some white topped ship of the plains black specks grouped here and there proved the presence of the livestock under herd over all shone a pleasant sun now and again the dark shadow of a moving cloud passed over the flat valley softening its high lights for the time at times as the sun
chosen that way of breaking it beneath her speechless anguish there burned the half conscious sense of having been unfairly treated when they had entered into their queer compact nick had known as well as she on what compromises and concessions the life they were to live together must be based that he should have forgotten it seemed so unbelievable that she wondered with a new leap of fear if he were using the wretched ellie s indiscretion as a means of escape from a tie already wearied of suddenly she raised her head with a laugh after all you were right when you wanted me to be your mistress he turned on her with an astonished stare you my mistress through all her pain she thrilled with pride at the discovery that such a possibility had long since become unthinkable to him but she insisted that day at the fulmers have you forgotten when you said it would be sheer madness for us to marry lansing stood leaning in the embrasure of the window his eyes fixed on the mosaic volutes of the floor i was right enough when i said it would be sheer madness for us to marry he rejoined at length she sprang up trembling well that s easily settled our compact oh that compact he interrupted her with an impatient laugh are nt you asking me to carry it out now because i said we d better part he paused but the compact i d almost forgotten it was to the effect was nt it that we were to give each other a helping hand if either of us had a better chance the thing was absurd of course a mere joke from my point of view at least i shall never want any better chance any other chance oh nick oh nick but then she was close to him his face looming down through her tears but he put her back it would have been easy enough would nt it he rejoined if we d been as detachable as all that as it is it s going to hurt horribly but talking it over wo nt help you were right just now when you asked how else we were going to live we re born parasites both i suppose or we d have found out some way long ago but i find there are things i might put up with for myself at a pinch and should probably in time that i ca nt let you put up with for me ever those cigars at como do you suppose i did nt know it was for me and this too well it wo nt do it wo nt do he stopped as if his courage failed him and she moaned out but your writing if your book s a success my poor susy that s all part of the humbug we both know that my sort of writing will never pay and what s the alternative except more of the same kind of baseness and getting more and more blunted to it at least till now i ve minded certain things i do nt want to go on till i find myself taking them for granted she reached out a timid hand but you need nt ever dear if you d only leave it to me he drew back sharply that seems simple to you i suppose well men are different he walked toward the dressing table and glanced at the little enamelled clock which had been one of her wedding presents time to dress is nt it shall you mind if i leave you to dine with streffy and whoever else is coming i d rather like a long tramp and no more talking just at present except with myself he passed her by and walked rapidly out of the room susy stood motionless unable to lift a detaining hand or to find a final word of appeal on her disordered dressing table mrs vanderlyn s gifts glittered in the rosy lamp light yes men were different as he said xi but there were necessary accommodations there always had been nick in old times had been the first to own it how they had laughed at the perpendicular people the people who went by on the other side since you could nt be a good samaritan without stooping over and poking into heaps of you did nt know what and now nick had suddenly become perpendicular susy that evening at the head of the dinner table saw in the breaks between her scudding thoughts the nauseatingly familiar faces of the people she called her friends strefford fred gillow a giggling fool of a young breckenridge of their new york group who had arrived that day and prince nerone altineri ursula s prince who in ursula s absence at a tiresome cure had quite simply and naturally preferred to join her husband at venice susy looked from one to the other of them as if with newly opened eyes and wondered what life would be like with no faces but such as theirs to furnish it ah nick had become perpendicular after all most people went through life making a given set of gestures like dance steps learned in advance if your dancing manual told you at a given time to be perpendicular you had to be automatically and that was nick but what on earth susy gillow s puzzled voice suddenly came to her as from immeasurable distances are you going to do in this beastly stifling hole for the rest of the summer ask nick my dear fellow strefford answered for her and by the way where is nick if one may ask young breckenridge interposed glancing up to take belated note of his host s absence dining out said susy glibly people turned up blighting bores that i would nt have dared to inflict on you how easily the old familiar
methods he never was personal or mean an addition to the slice of a house that really was generous entrancement filled her that really is kind of you she murmured gratefully it seems too much to ask you did not ask it was his answer but i shall benefit by it nothing could be nicer these rooms are so much too small glancing about her in flushed rapture and my bedroom is dreadful i m obliged to use rob s for a dressing room the new rooms will be for robin he said an excellent method he had discovered of entirely detaching himself from the excitements and emotions of other persons removed the usual difficulties in the way of disappointing speaking truths to or embarrassing people who deserved it it was this method which had utterly cast down the defences of andrews feather was so wholly left out of the situation that she was actually almost saved from its awkwardness when one is six he explained one will soon be seven nine twelve then the teens begin to loom up and one cannot be concealed in cupboards on a top floor even before that time a governess is necessary and even from the abyss of my ignorance i see that no respectable woman would stand either the night or the day nursery your daughter oh do nt call her that cried feather my daughter it sounds as if she were eighteen she felt as if she had a sudden hideous little shock six years had passed since bob died a daughter a school girl with long hair and long legs to keep out of the way a grown up girl to drag about with one never would she do it three sixes are eighteen coombe continued as was impressed upon one in early years by the multiplication table i never saw you so interested in anything before feather faltered climbing steep narrow horrid stairs to her nursery dismissing her nurse she paused a second because a very ugly little idea had clutched at her it arose from and was complicated with many fantastic half formed secret resentments of the past it made her laugh a shade hysterical are you going to see that she is properly brought up and educated so that if anyone important falls in love with her she can make a good match hers was quite a hideous little mind he was telling himself fearful in its latter day casting aside of all such small matters as taste and feeling people stripped the garments from things in these days he laughed inwardly at himself and his unwitting these days senile severity mouthed just such phrases were they not his own days and the outcome of a past which had considered itself so much more decorous had not boldly questionable attitudes been held in those other days how long was it since the prince regent himself had flourished it was only that these days brought it all close against one s eyes but this exquisite creature had a hideous little mind of her own whatsoever her day later he confessed to himself that he was unprepared to see her spring to her feet and stand before him absurdly fantastically near being impassioned you think i as too silly to see anything she broke forth but i do see a long way sometimes i ca nt bear it but i do i do i shall have a grown up daughter she will be the kind of girl everyone will look at and someone important may want to marry her but oh he was reminded of the day when she had fallen at his feet and clasped his rigid and reluctant knees this was something of the same feeble desperation of mood oh why could nt someone like that have wanted to marry me see she was like a pathetic fairy as she spread her nymphlike arms how pretty i am his gaze held her a moment in the singular fashion with which she had become actually familiar because at long intervals she kept seeing it again he quite gently took her fingers and returned her to her sofa please sit down again he requested it will be better she sat down without another imbecile word to say as for him he changed the subject with your permission benby will undertake the business of the lease and the building he explained the plans will be brought to you we will go over them together if you wish there will be decent rooms for robin and her governess the two nurseries can be made fit for human beings to live in and used for other purposes the house will be greatly improved it was nearly three o clock when feather went upstairs to her dozing maid because after he had left her she sat some time in the empty untidy little drawing room and gazed straight before her at a painted screen on which shepherdesses and swains were dancing in a watteau glade infested by flocks of little loves chapter xiv when from robin s embarrassed young consciousness there had welled up the hesitating confession she does nt like me she could not of course have found words in which to make the reasons for her knowledge clear but they had for herself no obscurity the fair being who at rare intervals fluttered on the threshold of her world had a way of looking at her with a shade of aloof distaste in her always transient gaze the unadorned fact was that feather did not like her she had been outraged by her advent a baby was absurdly out of the picture so far as her mind encompassed a future she saw herself flitting from flower to flower of smart pleasures and successes somehow with more money and more exalted invitations something vaguely having happened to the entire lawdor progeny and she therefore occupying a position in which it was herself

in coming to you and to do as you suggest would be simply to make that mistake worse spade nodded indifferently and waved his hand at the articles on the desk saying there s your stuff and then when cairo was returning them to his pockets it s understood that you re to pay my expenses while i m getting this black bird for you and five thousand dollars when it s done yes mr spade that is five thousand dollars less whatever moneys have been advanced to you five thousand in all right and it s a legitimate proposition spade s face was solemn except for wrinkles at the corners of his eyes you re not hiring me to do any murders or burglaries for you but simply to get it back if possible in an honest and lawful way if possible cairo agreed his face also was solemn except for the eyes and in any event with discretion he rose and picked up his hat i am at the hotel belvedere when you wish to communicate with me room six thirty five i confidently expect the greatest mutual benefit from our association mr spade he hesitated may i have my pistol sure i d forgotten it spade took the pistol out of his coat pocket and handed it to cairo cairo pointed the pistol at spade s chest you will please keep your hands on the top of the desk cairo said earnestly i intend to search your offices spade said i ll be damned then he laughed in his throat and said all right go ahead i wo nt stop you vi the undersized shadow for half an hour after joel cairo had gone spade sat alone still and frowning at his desk then he said aloud in the tone of one dismissing a problem well they re paying for it and took a bottle of manhattan cocktail and a paper drinking cup from a desk drawer he filled the cup two thirds full drank returned the bottle to the drawer tossed the cup into the wastebasket put on his hat and overcoat turned off the lights and went down to the night lit street an undersized youth of twenty or twenty one in neat grey cap and overcoat was standing idly on the corner below spade s building spade walked up sutter street to kearny where he entered a cigar store to buy two sacks of bull durham when he came out the youth was one of four people waiting for a street car on the opposite corner spade ate dinner at herbert s grill in powell street when he left the grill at a quarter to eight the youth was looking into a nearby haberdasher s window spade went to the hotel belvedere asking at the desk for mr cairo he was told that cairo was not in the youth sat in a chair in a far corner of the lobby spade went to the geary theatre failed to see cairo in the lobby and posted himself on the curb in front facing the theatre the youth loitered with other loiterers before marquard s restaurant below at ten minutes past eight joel cairo appeared walking up geary street with his little mincing bobbing steps apparently he did not see spade until the private detective touched his shoulder he seemed moderately surprised for a moment and then said oh yes of course you saw the ticket uh huh i ve got something i want to show you spade drew cairo back towards the curb a little away from the other waiting theatre goers the kid in the cap down by marquard s cairo murmured i ll see and looked at his watch he looked up geary street he looked at a theatre sign in front of him on which george arliss was shown costumed as shylock and then his dark eyes crawled sidewise in their sockets until they were looking at the kid in the cap at his cool pale face with curling lashes hiding lowered eyes who is he spade asked cairo smiled up at spade i do not know him he s been tailing me around town cairo wet his lower lip with his tongue and asked do you think it was wise then to let him see us together how do i know spade replied anyway it s done cairo removed his hat and smoothed his hair with a gloved hand he replaced his hat carefully on his head and said with every appearance of candor i give you my word i do not know him mr spade i give you my word i have nothing to do with him i have asked nobody s assistance except yours on my word of honor then he s one of the others that may be i just wanted to know because if he gets to be a nuisance i may have to hurt him do as you think best he is not a friend of mine that s good there goes the curtain good night spade said and crossed the street to board a westbound street car the youth in the cap boarded the same car spade left the car at hyde street and went up to his apartment his rooms were not greatly upset but showed unmistakable signs of having been searched when spade had washed and had put on a fresh shirt and collar he went out again walked up to sutter street and boarded a westbound car the youth boarded it also within half a dozen blocks of the coronet spade left the car and went into the vestibule of a tall brown apartment building he pressed three bell buttons together the street door lock buzzed he entered passed the elevator and stairs went down a long yellow walled

show up in course of time probably he had come on a bitch in heat which was about the only thing that would keep him gone so long from night before to going on to noon maybe evans thought he should have hunted more but the morning already was halfway gone thanks to the wedding and the company had to roll out miles and he hated to own up to it but he had felt a little foolish and exposed whistling around the fort and by the outside of indian lodges while tadlock looked on smiling wise as if to say i told you way back at the start that dogs would hold you up it was nt tadlock that forced him on though it was time and time a passing and last night s talk of snow and he already sore inside at what his boy had done the dog would turn up that s what he had told brownie who was nt so carried off by marriage as to forget about old rock and that was what he looked to happen rock would just turn up his mouth open in what went for a grin his eyes remembering from the night meantime the train must move you could nt ask the folks to keep on waiting just for a misplaced dog no matter if the dog was rock evans slid over in the saddle and cocked the other shoulder to the wind except for the weather coming at him a man would nt think that hard miles lay ahead the road looked pretty open as if swift crossings and rough mountains were just dreamed up in greenwood s head three hundred miles to boise or something close to that more by way of walla walla which way they would nt go since summers said it was nt needful eight hundred miles to the home they had nt seen eight hundred to the new life giddap horse take away the gray sky take away the wind and things looked gentle cattle grazing horses grazing a bunch of indians bound for hall their horses dragging poles on which their goods were loaded green grass growing tall grass growing trees fringed along the snake but the gray sky was here and the wind and they put a man in mind of winter winter would be along soon the smell of it was in the air like the smell of a thing out of sight beyond the bend it made a man feel half like saying enough half like staying the season out in the grassy fort hall bottoms and maybe staying longer cattle could be grown here and horses and probably crops though not a spade of earth had been turned and the indians would get over being meddlesome and pecky just what pushed people on evans asked and did nt bother thinking why for reasons seemed no good today it was enough to answer that oregon had put a spell on them it had put a spell on all of them except for tadlock and davisworth and brewer and mcbee except for one mcbee and he would try to act like real kinfolks to that one mcbee like rebecca told him to rebecca had taken the news quiet as if she d seen it coming and had nt argued that he knew of or scolded or asked brownie to wait she had talked with him a long time while evans kept himself away not trusting himself to speak more about it he had gone to bed finally and had heard their voices a piece off from the tent just as a murmur rebecca did nt speak when she first came back but undressed quietly and came to bed and by and by put her hand on his shoulder knowing somehow that he did nt sleep maybe it ai nt the way i might hope lije she whispered so that brownie would nt hear it ai nt the way i d hoped but still it might turn out to be you hold yourself in lije i told him if he was sot all right i recollect when you was young think on it lije i got me a real woman might be he has she s a good young un do nt judge too quick seems like you think it s just fine her hand patted him we got to take what comes and make the best of it and not the worst you be nice to her what chafed him was he knew that she was right he said i d just as leave not talk tonight i m tired and cranky too i reckon but in the morning it was just this morning come to think of it what worried her was what the girl would wear women were queer sometimes even becky it turned out the girl was dressed all right had shoes on and a dress with a frilly collar and she had twisted her hair up in a way that made her face look frail and pretty prettier than ever there was no denying the girl was pretty weatherby had done the trick quick knowing the train must move but still the knot was likely tight enough too tight it might turn out weatherby had been pleased at a marrying maybe because it was the opposite of the funerals he had had to preach promising life instead of marking the end of it how did it go what god hath joined together let no man put asunder the picture of the wedding stood in evans mind as he hunched into the wind that got inside his clothes and felt around his ribs the men and women gathered in the fort hall yard so s to be in shelter and a few favorite indians with them wondering at the white man s medicine and brownie standing stiff and the girl indrawn and pale and weatherby asking in
through it a boxcar roared past chopping the empty space in two and one of the women laughed do you think i believe in jesus he said leaning toward her and speaking almost as if he were breathless well i would nt even if he existed even if he was on this train who said you had to she asked in a poisonous eastern voice he drew back the waiter brought his dinner he began eating slowly at first then faster as the women concentrated on watching the muscles that stood out on his jaw when he chewed he was eating something spotted with eggs and livers he finished that and drank his coffee and then pulled his money out the steward saw him but he would nt come total the bill every time he passed the table he would wink at the women and stare at haze mrs hitchcock and the lady had already finished and gone finally the man came and added up the bill haze shoved the money at him and then pushed past him out of the car for a while he stood between two train cars where there was fresh air of a sort and made a cigarette then the porter passed between the two cars hey you parrum he called the porter did nt stop haze followed him into the car all the berths were made up the man in the station in melsy had sold him a berth because he said he would have to sit up all night in the coaches he had sold him an upper one haze went to it and pulled his sack down and went into the men s room and got ready for the night he was too full and he wanted to hurry and get in the berth and lie down he thought he would lie there and look out the window and watch how the country went by a train at night a sign said to get the porter to let you into the uppers he stuck his sack up into his berth and then went to look for the porter he did nt find him at one end of the car and he started back to the other going around the corner he ran into something heavy and pink it gasped and muttered clumsy it was mrs hitchcock in a pink wrapper with her hair in knots around her head she looked at him with her eyes squinted nearly shut the knobs framed her face like dark toadstools she tried to get past him and he tried to let her but they were both moving the same way each time her face became purplish except for little white marks over it that did nt heat up she drew herself stiff and stopped and said what is the matter with you he slipped past her and dashed down the aisle and ran into the porter so that the porter fell down you got to let me into the berth parrum he said the porter picked himself up and went lurching down the aisle and after a minute he came lurching back again stone faced with the ladder haze stood watching him while he put the ladder up then he started up it halfway up he turned and said i remember you your father was a nigger named cash parrum you ca nt go back there neither nor anybody else not if they wanted to i m from chicago the porter said in an irritated voice my name is not parrum cash is dead haze said he got the cholera from a pig the porter s mouth jerked down and he said my father was a railroad man haze laughed the porter jerked the ladder off suddenly with a wrench of his arm that sent the boy clutching at the blanket into the berth he lay on his stomach for a few minutes and did nt move after a while he turned and found the light and looked around him there was no window he was closed up in the thing except for a little space over the curtain the top of the berth was low and curved over he lay down and noticed that the curved top looked as if it were not quite closed it looked as if it were closing he lay there for a while not moving there was something in his throat like a sponge with an egg taste he did nt want to turn over for fear it would move he wanted the light off he reached up without turning and felt for the button and snapped it and the darkness sank down on him and then faded a little with light from the aisle that came in through the foot of space not closed he wanted it all dark he did nt want it diluted he heard the porter s footsteps coming down the aisle soft into the rug coming steadily down brushing against the green curtains and fading up the other way out of hearing then after a while when he was almost asleep he thought he heard them again coming back his curtains stirred and the footsteps faded in his half sleep he thought where he was lying was like a coffin the first coffin he had seen with someone in it was his grandfather s they had left it propped open with a stick of kindling the night it had sat in the house with the old man in it and haze had watched from a distance thinking he ai nt going to let them shut it on him when the time comes his elbow is going to shoot into the crack his grandfather had been a circuit preacher a waspish old man who had ridden over three counties with jesus hidden in his head like a stinger when it was time to bury him they shut the top of his box down and he did
control i got dumped and hurt my shoulder and this put me on light duty with too much time to think at a time when i had many reasons it seemed to me to feel sorry for myself because of light duty i was orderly that day in the battalion commander s office i was eager at first for i had never been there before and wanted to make a good impression i discovered that captain frankel did nt want zeal he wanted me to sit still say nothing and not bother him this left me time to sympathize with myself for i did nt dare go to sleep then suddenly shortly after lunch i was nt a bit sleepy sergeant zim came in followed by three men zim was smart and neat as usual but the expression on his face made him look like death on a pale horse and he had a mark on his right eye that looked as if it might be shaping up into a shiner which was impossible of course of the other three the one in the middle was ted hendrick he was dirty well the company had been on a field exercise they do nt scrub those prairies and you spend a lot of your time snuggling up to the dirt but his lip was split and there was blood on his chin and on his shirt and his cap was missing he looked wild eyed the men on each side of him were boots they each had rifles hendrick did not one of them was from my squad a kid named leivy he seemed excited and pleased and slipped me a wink when nobody was looking captain frankel looked surprised what is this sergeant zim stood frozen straight and spoke as if he were reciting something by rote sir h company commander reports to the battalion commander discipline article nine one oh seven disregard of tactical command and doctrine the team being in simulated combat article nine one two oh disobedience of orders same conditions captain frankel looked puzzled you are bringing this to me sergeant officially i do nt see how a man can manage to look as embarrassed as zim looked and still have no expression of any sort in his face or voice sir if the captain pleases the man refused administrative discipline he insisted on seeing the battalion commander i see a bedroll lawyer well i still do nt understand it sergeant but technically that s his privilege what was the tactical command and doctrine a freeze sir i glanced at hendrick thinking oh oh he s going to catch it in a freeze you hit dirt taking any cover you can fast and then freeze do nt move at all not even twitch an eyebrow until released or you can freeze when you re already in cover they tell stories about men who had been hit while in freeze and had died slowly but without ever making a sound or a move frankel s brows shot up second part same thing sir after breaking freeze failing to return to it on being so ordered captain frankel looked grim name zim answered hendrick t c sir recruit private r p seven nine six oh nine two four very well hendrick you are deprived of all privileges for thirty days and restricted to your tent when not on duty or at meals subject only to sanitary necessities you will serve three hours extra duty each day under the corporal of the guard one hour to be served just before taps one hour just before reveille one hour at the time of the noonday meal and in place of it your evening meal will be bread and water as much bread as you can eat you will serve ten hours extra duty each sunday the time to be adjusted to permit you to attend divine services if you so elect i thought oh my he threw the book captain frankel went on hendrick the only reason you are getting off so lightly is that i am not permitted to give you any more than that without convening a court martial and i do nt want to spoil your company s record dismissed he dropped his eyes back to the papers on his desk the incident already forgotten and hendrick yelled you did nt hear my side of it the captain looked up oh sorry you have a side you darn right i do sergeant zim s got it in for me he s been riding me riding me riding me all day long from the time i got here he that s his job the captain said coldly do you deny the two charges against you no but he did nt tell you i was lying on an anthill frankel looked disgusted oh so you would get yourself killed and perhaps your teammates as well because of a few little ants not just a few there were hundreds of em stingers so young man let me put you straight had it been a nest of rattlesnakes you would still have been expected and required to freeze frankel paused have you anything at all to say in your own defense hendrick s mouth was open i certainly do he hit me he laid hands on me the whole bunch of em are always strutting around with those silly batons whackin you across the fanny punchin you between the shoulders and tellin you to brace up and i put up with it but he hit me with his hands he knocked me down to the ground and yelled freeze you stupid jackass how about that captain frankel looked down at his hands looked up again at hendrick young man you are under a misapprehension very common among civilians you think that your superior officers are not permitted to lay hands on you as you put it under purely social conditions that
this would make the drunk go away but it brought him closer to us his face under the blue streetlight seemed splashed with purple do nt lie for him he said with exquisite gentleness he s not worth it how much is he giving you i do nt care how much it is it s never enough when he gets a new pretty boy he ll throw you out on the street like an old trojan daddy let s go i said frightened now and chilled clear through the night went in one side of me and came out the other and encountered no obstacle my father began to push around him and the drunk lifted his hand and my father in answer lifted his own hand this made the drunk take a back step and he nearly fell knock me down the drunk said smiling so broadly his cheeks gleamed knock me down when i want to save your soul are you ready to die this made my father jerk still like a halted movie the drunk seeing his triumph repeated are you ready to die the drunk nimbly sidestepped to me and put his arm around my waist and gave me a hug his breath was like the odor the seniors taking chemistry sometimes left in room before we came in for thursday study hall a complex stench both sulphurous and sweet ah he told me you re a good warm body but you re all skin and bone does nt the old bastard feed you hey you he called to my father what sort of an old lech do you call yourself lifting these poor boys off the street with empty stomachs i thought i was ready to die my father said but now i wonder if anybody ever is i wonder now if a ninety nine year old chinaman with tuberculosis gonorrhea syphilis and toothache is ready to die the drunk s fingers began to gouge under my ribs and i jerked out of his grasp daddy let s go no peter my father said this gentleman is talking sense are you ready to die he asked the drunk what do you think the answer is squinting shoulders back chest preening the drunk with pigeon dignity stepped into my father s tall shadow and looking up told him carefully i ll be ready to die when you and everybody like you is locked up in jail and they throw away the key you ca nt even let these poor kids rest on a night like this he looked over at me under frowning eyebrows and said shall we call the cops kid let s kill this old nance huh to my father he said what about it chief how much is it worth to you not to have me call the cops and have you picked up with this flower he inflated his chest as if to shout but the street dwindled northward toward infinity without upholding another visible soul just the painted brick fronts with the little railed porches characteristic of alton the stone stoops now and then bearing an ornamented cement flower pot the leafless curbside trees alternating and in the end mixing with the telephone poles parked cars lined this street but few passed down it because it met a dead end at the essick s factory wall two blocks away we stood beside the long low cement block back of a brewery warehouse its corrugated green doors had slammed tight shut and the memory of the clang seemed to make the air here hard the drunk began to pluck at my father s chest rubbing his thumb and fingers after each pluck as if disposing of a louse or a piece of lint ten dollars he said ten dollars and my mouth is he pressed three blue fingers against his swollen violet lips and held them there as if testing how long he could hold his breath at last he lifted them away exhaled a huge feather of frozen vapor smiled and said so ten dollars buys me lock stock and barrel he winked at me and asked is that a bargain kid or not what s he paying you he s my father i insisted frantic my father was kneading his spotted hands together under the lamplight and the uprightness of his posture seemed a stiffness as if he had been poleaxed and in the next instant would fall five dollars the drunk quickly said to him five lousy dollars and without waiting for an answer he dropped to one one little bitty dollar bill so i can get myself a drink and stop freezing to death come on chief give me a break i ll even tell you a hotel where they do nt ask any questions i know all about hotels my father said in the depression i took a job as night clerk at the old osiris before they closed it down the bedbugs got to be as big as the prostitutes so the customers could nt tell em apart i guess the osiris was before your time the drunk lost his grin i come from easton originally he said it occurred to me with a shock that he was much younger than my father indeed he was virtually a boy like me my father dug into his pocket and brought out some change and gave it to the young man i d like to give you more my friend but i just do nt have it this is my last thirty five cents i m a public school teacher and our pay scale is way behind that of industry i ve enjoyed talking to you though and i d like to shake your hand and he did you ve clarified my thinking he told the drunk my father turned and walked back the way we had come and i hurried to follow the things we had been
he ll kill you not so the voice dissented again calmly no he ca nt kill you he s already done his damnedest you ve survived his worst don t listen run for your life he ll beat you unconscious then strangle you where you lie for god s sake don t get up listen to me he wo nt kill you if he wanted you dead he could have gutted you with that peavey pole leaning against the garage there or he could have cut your throat with that whittling knife he carries or just could have stomped your head in with those boots when you were looking for your tooth over there in the gravel pile he s not trying to kill you oh the first voice stopped its shrilling and demanded with a sly arrogance then what are we flailing around to get up out of this berry vine for to stagger back out in the gravel and lose another tooth if he isn t bent on homicide what logical reason have we for trying to rise to defend ourselves i ceased my thorny struggle for a second perplexed by this new tack yes now that you mention it why i pondered the question as the world of my left eye rapidly shrank to a blue lined slit why indeed then hank mistaking my hesitation for surrender stepped over to extend a hand of aid i took it and he dragged me from the vines because if he knows already that i can could have killed him might have killed him would have would have just as sure as sin if he had kept on just standing there letting me beat him up in front of viv just like he would have drowned under that car at the beach on halloween if it had been left up to him but this time he did nt just stand to my everlasting surprise the kid had fought back even after she d seen all she needed well hank asked you had it i was grateful for the opportunity i think so good goddam deal because i m shot clean to hell let s wash up this time he had fought with nobody to pull him out from under what he knew was maybe death when he crawled in under it nobody to pull him out but himself we walked back to the landing and squatted there tossing water into our faces i rose to get the album with viv s photo from the boat then returned andy silently offered a handkerchief and we silently accepted taking turns there was no more shouting either from across the river or inside the head no more stomping no more voices it was quiet and when i saw this i gave up my notion of homicide i had already cooled down a good deal for one thing because i got to realizing that whether lee knew it or not him prodding me into a hassle was for much more than just viv s benefit and for another thing it just ai nt so light a chore doing a man in i do nt care how hot you are under the collar if that man himself decides to do something against it we finished up washing and walked up to stand in the garage the kid was looking pretty stunned by all the action he d been in so was old andy and me too i imagine none of us thought leland had that much gumption to him well you can take the jeep on in if you want i told him i ll stay an talk a little with andy i believe about this mill fire business but how ll you get it back from town lee asked me and said i can hitchhike i ve done it before if you want to keep it here naw i patted the jeep on the hood it was still hot go on and use her i told him i ll send somebody in in a little bit with andy to bring her back lee did nt say anything to that he was looking pretty solemn up at that window but some way i felt like kidding a bit the only thing i ask is you take care of her she s mighty finicky sometimes what he said it tickled me to fruster him that way it always had what are you the jeep i m asking will you take care of her he looked at the dock best that i can she may need gas i took out my wallet i can give you some cash no i ll be all right with my wages and policy you re sure you ll say so if you need some more money you ll get word back i promise andy man what do you say me and you ride over t the house and get me some of lee s blood outa my hair and talk about grinning black cats and the like hey over a bottle of johnny walker what say okeedoke then bub so long and maybe we ll see you around sometime and we left him there starting the jeep and walked back down to the boat i was feeling all right maybe not in god s pocket because it ai nt so easy a thing losing a wife but more all right about myself than i had in a good spell in the attic viv reaches out to pull the window closed in just the short time it has been open the rain has swollen the edges enough to make shutting it difficult by the time she has it wedged shut again the jeep has pulled away down the road and hank and andy are returning in the boat hank seems cheerful when she greets him downstairs she does nt mention the fight she ca nt tell if he knows she was watching
promptly and dropped letters as he answered them straight into the wastebasket laurel had seen him do it and when it concerned her mother if that was what she asked for he went but there was nothing of her mother here for fay to find or for herself to retrieve the only traces there were of anybody were the drops of nail varnish laurel studiously went to work on them she lifted them from the surface of the desk and rubbed it afterwards with wax until nothing was left to show of them either that was on saturday laurel remember when we really were the bridesmaids tish cried as they sat over drinks after dinner it was sunday evening while the bridesmaids parents still lived within a few blocks of the mckelva house the bridesmaids and their husbands had mostly all built new houses in the new part of mount salus their own children were farther away still off in college now tish s youngest son was still at home he wo nt come out though tish had said he has company a girl came in through his bedroom window to play chess with him that s what she said i think she s the same one who came in through his window last night close to eleven o clock i saw car lights in the driveway and went to see they call him every minute girls he s fifteen and remember mama at the wedding tish said now crying when it was over saying to your father oh clint is nt it the saddest thing and judge mac saying why no tennyson if i had thought there was anything sad to be said for it i should have prevented it prevented it i never saw a man enjoy a wedding more said gert wartime or no wartime we had pink champagne that judge mac sent all the way to new orleans for one of the others cried and a five piece negro band remember miss becky thought it was utter extravagance child foolishness but judge mac insisted on it all a big wedding right on down the line well laurel was an only child mother had a superstitious streak underneath laurel said protectively she might have had a notion it was unlucky to make too much of your happiness from her place on the chaise longue by the window she saw lightning flickering now in the western sky like the feathers of a bird taking a bath judge mac laughed her out of it then remember the parties we had for you gert gave laurel a lovingly derisive slap that was before the old country club burned down there never was another dance floor like that what kind of dancer was phil polly i forget tish lifted her arms as though the memory would come up and dance her away to remind her firm said laurel she turned her cheek a little further away on the pillow your daddy knew how to enjoy a grand occasion as well as we did as long as it stayed elegant and as long as papa did nt get too high before it was over tish said of course mama should have saved all her tears for her own child s wedding tish was the only divorce as laurel was the only widow tish had eloped with the captain of their high school football team but miss becky would rather go through anything than a grand occasion said gert i remember once it must ve been the bar association meeting or maybe when he was mayor and they had to function at some to do in jackson anyway once judge mac himself bought miss becky a dress to wear came home with it in a box and surprised her beaded crepe shot beads neck to hem shot beads said tish where could you have been laurel gert said he d picked it out in new orleans some clerk sold it to him music started up from off in another room of the house duke ellington the young do nt dance to him they play chess to him i suppose tish said aside to laurel and miss becky said clinton if i d just been told in advance you were going to make me an extravagant present i d have asked you for a load of floor sweepings from the cottonseed oil mill ca nt you hear her tish cried she wore it though did nt she one of them asked and tish said oh they d do anything for each other sure she wore it and the weight she had to carry miss becky told mama in confidence that when she was nt wearing that dress which was nearly a hundred per cent of the time she had to keep it in a bucket the bridesmaids laughed till they cried but when she wanted to justify him she wore it with an air what floored me laurel was him getting married again when i saw fay said gert when i saw what he had there mama for his sake asked at the beginning if she would nt be allowed to give some sort of little welcome for her a sitdown tea i believe she had in mind and fay said oh please do nt bother with a big wholesale reception that kind of thing was for becky poor judge mac because except when it came to picking a wife tish said smiling at laurel he was a pretty worldly old sweet since when have you started laughing at them laurel asked in a trembling voice are they just figures from now on to make a good story she turned on tish and you can wink over father polly tish grabbed her we were nt laughing at them they were nt funny no more than my father and mother are no more than all our fathers and mothers are she laughed again into laurel
it as he wanted every night but he was good to her even then he did not cheat and beat her both which meant he was good to her according to her mother his mother the other women in the neighborhood and in fact just about everyone she knew who seemed always to expect the two occurrences together like the twin faces of a single plague but had she lost interest in sex completely she did nt know it was simply that sex was now something that she knew and thought she understood before it had been curiosity about her body s power nor was her response to eddie s lovemaking as uncomplicated as he appeared to think she had not been wandering exactly on those afternoons she had found herself in front of daxter s funeral home that huge snowy two storied building that stood on a hill between a church and an all night cafe daxter s was owned by george daxter an obese half white man in his fifties his mother so the story went was white when her parents found she was pregnant by the black man who worked for them they shut her up in the cellar and threw away the key they fed her pig bran and a little watery milk when daxter was born he was thrown out into the street with the rest of the trash he was raised by an old woman who later died of tomaine poisoning she had eaten some sour rotten tomatoes daxter gave her daxter had been after meridian since she was twelve years old she would visit the funeral home on saturday afternoons as everybody did to see who was new in the viewing room daxter would entice her into the small back office where he kept a long sofa and two soft chairs at first she thought daxter generous he gave her candy for a swift exploratory feel when she became older fifteen or so he would take out his wallet crammed with money and leave it on the sofa between them while he felt her breasts and tried to pull her onto his lap the only part she liked was when he sucked her nipples and she liked to hear his breathing like his throat was closing when she let one chubby hand touch the bottom of her panties she could sit holding his head against her breasts where he busily and noisily sucked and feel the hot throbbing of his passion almost enter her but his obesity in the end was distasteful to her she had heard that fat men had short stunted penises she imagined daxter s penis to look like an english walnut when daxter was not around she allowed herself to be chased around the embalming table by his young assistant an almost handsome man but dissipated and with a face that as the saying went begged for pussy he thought of nothing else his tool of seduction his description was his voice which he used to describe the act of intercourse holding her with her back tight against him so that his penis was like a hard live bedpost against her hips he would whisper in her ear think of how it would feel he would urge grabbing one then both of her nipples to have this big black long ummm and he would press the bedpost against her inside you slippin in and slippin out she hated him but was fascinated she was also far from immune to the voice the assistant would manipulate her breasts and cram her between his legs and rub her so against him that her panties became flooded with the residue of her resistance the assistant was very clever and so never actually forced her beyond a certain point but each time he left her with one of his little homilies experience is the best the only teacher and just looking at water will never teach you to swim one day the assistant who knew he said how much she wanted to was ready to be fucked if not by him then by the voice the bedpost arranged for her to watch him while he seduced another schoolgirl the same girl in fact who did baby sitting for his wife he did it in the small shed where the wicker baskets were stored she watched because she was curious wanted to learn without doing if possible and because she had nothing better to do on a hot wednesday afternoon the assistant began by standing with his bedpost against the back of the girl she was about sixteen and wore loafers and a red cardigan sweater turned backward with a neat little white collar her small brown hands kept checking the collar to be sure it had not become unfastened by the stripping quality of the assistant s words his hands were elsewhere already under the cardigan kneading the nipples then into her pants as her skirt fell to the floor then he hoisted her up onto the table and began to fuck her standing up then up on the table the girl was bucking up and down as fast as she could as if she feared to break a rhythm she had learned by heart the voice fucked more slowly expertly like a machine and the voice never stopped talking at the end he watched her as if from a distance his voice a monotone his face greedy obscene and ugly when the girl tried to bury her face in his chest and force his arms around her he pushed her away the assistant said later that the girl was his now whenever he wanted her because he had discovered a secret few men knew how to make a woman come by using nothing but his penis and his beautiful voice these were his gifts the assistant said more skillful than the suppleness of wrist required to extract cold blood from a cadaver
nevertheless as an extra precaution even the mixing engineers were told that they were working on a picture called the mendocino story in the course of the mix the music track the voice track and the sound effects track were all fit together and the resulting sound track combined with the images made a single piece of film called the answer print show me an answer print said vito pointing with thanksgiving and weary glory to the six double reels of film that filled two metal carrying cases and i ll show you a motion picture limply billy thought that if nothing else marriage had added to her vocabulary the two cases held the net results of months of virtually nonstop work the cooperation of hundreds of people the total commitment of one small group the expenditure of more than two million dollars and an incalculable number of small miracles bad weather illness on the part of the actors accidents in labs or any one of the hundreds of other things that can go wrong during the shooting of a picture had nt happened the inevitable series of minor and major crises had somehow been surmounted by vito s absolute determination to make this movie and make it fast luck and billy had been on his side it was mid november when vito had his answer print at last curt arvey was in new york his difficulties with vito were merely infuriating compared to the huge disaster the studio was facing with its major production a star studded musical based on dickens pickwick papers a fifteen million dollar film which the studio had been counting on for christmas release and the family trade pickwick which should have been finished months ago was still a month behind schedule and bogging down day by day it was now almost three million dollars over budget and arvey s board of directors had summoned him to new york to explain pickwick had been booked into two hundred and fifty carefully chosen topnotch first run houses and it was obvious that no combination of events would enable them to meet those dates vito telephoned oliver sloan the head of sales at arvey film studio you fellows can see the answer print of mirrors now oliver he announced casually jeezus that s the head of sales checked his unseemly astonishment at the incredible speed with which the picture had come through postproduction i ll have to call you back on that vito anytime vito responded knowing that sloan would have to report to arvey before he said anything more with difficulty oliver sloan reached his employer in his hotel suite in manhattan after a brief conversation he hung up and sighed to his assistant arvey said to burn the fucking print when orsini walks in the door and to throw his ass in jail what are you going to do we ll see it first i think before we burn it mr arvey was nt in one of his better moods sloan then called vito and set up a screening for the next day with the gloom of a medical examiner about to perform his ten thousandth autopsy the next afternoon at two the big screening room was half filled with the upper echelon of the studio s sales advertising and promotion departments some sixteen men in all four of them brought their secretaries who by virtue of seniority and tradition often deigned to come to screenings of new pictures since there were no big stars in mirrors they had scant interest in the film itself but each of them wanted to be among the first in the studio secretary population to know what billy ikehorn s husband had come up with the sixteen men as was their wont made no audible reactions to the picture except for a few coughs and the sound of cigarettes being lit as the film ended the four secretaries scrambled out a side door as inconspicuously as possible and the men sat a minute in the traditional noncommittal silence but this time it was deeper and longer than usual everyone waited for the reaction of oliver sloan eventually he said thanks vito see you around and walked out he was followed by the other men discussing business matters in low tones either ignoring vito or else greeting him with tiny meaningless nods vito waited until the last man had left and quickly slipped out of the screening room he walked down the hall to the executive men s room there he slid quietly into a stall and waited oliver sloan s voice was the first he heard jeezus this is the first time i ve been able to go in four days this job is getting more binding every year you should complain i get the runs had em a week jeezus jim arvey ll have a heart attack but this picture is going to save his ass we can use it to fill all those dates for pickwick fucking orsini what a fantastic picture beautiful fucking beautiful yeah it s gonna work oli gonna make it how many prints do we order say two hundred seventy five be on the safe side fucking orsini why d the girls leave like that in such a hurry embarrassed i guess they d run out of kleenexes dripping tears all over the place secretaries emotional types yeah jeezus a happy ending ll do it every time females they ve got no emotional control i thought gracie was about to start sobbing right out loud had to pinch her hard who knows from women gracie eats nails for lunch and then goes all sentimental vito had heard enough smiling like a conquering caesar he left the stall and stood at the door to the men s room addressing the four well polished shoes planted on the floor under the stalls i m delighted that you like the picture gentlemen enjoy a good crap

were talking in the kitchen of a three hundred year old dutch farmhouse in upstate new jersey there were three of them in the room nick vito joseph colella and salvatore little flower fiore nick vito was a cadaverous looking man with thin lips that were almost invisible and deep green eyes that were dead he wore two hundred dollar shoes and white socks joseph big joe colella was a huge slab of a man a granite monolith and when he walked he looked like a building moving someone had once called him a vegetable garden colella s got a potato nose cauliflower ears and a pea brain colella had a soft high pitched voice and a deceptively gentle manner he owned a race horse and had an uncanny knack for picking winners he was a family man with a wife and six children his specialties were guns acid and chains joe s wife carmelina was a strict catholic and on sundays when colella was not working he always took his family to church the third man salvatore fiore was almost a midget he stood five feet three inches and weighed a hundred and fifteen pounds he had the innocent face of a choirboy and was equally adept with a gun or a knife women were greatly attracted to the little man and he boasted a wife half a dozen girl friends and a beautiful mistress fiore had once been a jockey working the tracks from pimlico to tijuana when the racing commissioner at hollywood park banned fiore for doping a horse the commissioner s body was found floating in lake tahoe a week later the three men were soldati in antonio granelli s family but it was michael moretti who had brought them in and they belonged to him body and soul in the dining room a family meeting was taking place seated at the head of the table was antonio granelli capo of the most powerful mafia family on the east coast seventy two years old he was still a powerful looking man with the shoulders and broad chest of a laborer and a shock of white hair born in palermo sicily antonio granelli came to america when he was fifteen and went to work on the waterfront on the west side of lower manhattan by the time he was twenty one he was lieutenant to the dock boss the two men had an argument and when the boss mysteriously disappeared antonio granelli had taken over anyone who wanted to work on the docks had to pay him he had used the money to begin his climb to power and had expanded rapidly branching out into loan sharking and the numbers racket prostitution and gambling and drugs and murder over the years he had been indicted thirty two times and had only been convicted once on a minor assault charge granelli was a ruthless man with the down to earth cunning of a peasant and a total amorality to granelli s left sat thomas colfax the family consigliere twenty five years earlier colfax had had a brilliant future as a corporation lawyer but he had defended a small olive oil company which turned out to be mafia controlled and step by step had been lured into handling other cases for the mafia until finally through the years the granelli family had become his sole client it was a very lucrative client and thomas colfax became a wealthy man with extensive real estate holdings and bank accounts all over the world to the right of antonio granelli sat michael moretti his son in law michael was ambitious a trait that made granelli nervous michael did not fit into the pattern of the family his father giovanni a distant cousin of antonio granelli had been born not in sicily but in florence that alone made the moretti family suspect everybody knew that florentines were not to be trusted giovanni moretti had come to america and opened a shop as a shoemaker running it honestly without even a back room for gambling or loan sharking or girls which made him stupid giovanni s son michael was entirely different he had put himself through yale and the wharton school of business when michael had finished school he had gone to his father with one request he wanted to meet his distant relative antonio granelli the old shoemaker had gone to see his cousin and the meeting had been arranged granelli was sure that michael was going to ask for a loan so that he
away freud had an easy summer at the arbuthnot the bear simply had nt turned out to be the gold mine freud had hoped for what freud wanted was a different bear with a bear this dumb he told my mother and father there s no point in trying to better my take and you got other problems when you hustle them cheap resorts my mother took my father s hand and gave it firm warning pressure perhaps because she saw him imagining those other problems those cheap resorts but my father was thinking of his tuition at harvard he liked the indian and the bear called state o maine he had nt seen freud put the slightest effort into training the bear and win berry was a boy who believed in himself coach bob s son was a young man who imagined he could do anything he could imagine he had earlier planned that after the summer at the arbuthnot he would go to cambridge take a room and find a job perhaps in boston he would get to know the area around harvard and get employed in the vicinity so that as soon as there was money for tuition he could enroll this way he imagined he might even be able to keep a part time job and go to harvard my mother of course had liked this plan because boston to dairy and back again was an easy trip on the boston maine the trains ran regularly then she was already imagining the visits from my father long weekends and perhaps the occasional though proper visits she might make to cambridge or boston to see him what do you know about bears anyway she asked or motorcycles she did nt like either his idea that if freud was unwilling to part with his indian or his bear father would travel the logging camps with freud win berry was a strong boy but not vulgar and mother imagined the camps to be vulgar places from which father would not emerge the same or would not emerge at all she need nt have worried that summer and how it would end were obviously planned more hugely and inevitably than any trivial arrangements my father and mother could imagine ahead of them that summer of was as inevitable as the war in europe as it would soon be called and all of them freud mary bates and winslow berry were as lightly tossed along by the summer as the gulls knocked about in the rough currents at the mouth of the kennebec one night in late august when mother had served at the evening meal and had only just had time to change into her saddle shoes and the long skirt she played croquet in father was called from his room to assist with an injured man father ran past the lawn for croquet where mother was waiting for him she held a mallet over her shoulder the christmas like light bulbs strung in the trees lit the lawn for croquet in such a ghostly way that to my father my mother looked like an angel holding a club i ll be right with you father said to her someone s been hurt she came with him and some other running men and they ran down to the hotel piers alongside the dock was a throbbing big ship aglow with lights a band with too much brass was playing on board and the strong fuel smell and motor exhaust in the salt air mixed with the smell of crushed fruit it appeared that some enormous bowl of alcoholic fruit punch was being served to the ship s guests and they were spilling it over themselves or washing the deck down with it at the end of the dock a man lay on his side bleeding from a wound in his cheek he had stumbled coming up the ladder and had torn his face on a mooring cleat he was a large man his face florid in the blue wash of the light from the moon and he sat up as soon as anybody touched him scheiss he said my father and mother recognized the german word for shit from freud s many performances with the assistance of several strong young men the german was brought to his feet he had bled magnificently over his white dinner jacket which seemed large enough to clothe two men his blue black cummerbund resembled a curtain and his matching bow tie stuck up straight at his throat like a twisted propeller he was rather jowly and he smelled strongly of the fruit punch served on board ship he bellowed to someone from on board came a chorus of german and a tall tanned woman in an evening dress with yellow lace or ruching came up the dock s ladder like a panther wearing silk the bleeding man seized her and leaned on her so heavily that the woman despite her own obvious strength and agility was pushed into my father who helped her maintain her balance she was much younger than the man my mother noted and also german speaking in an easy clucking manner to him while he continued to bleat and gesture nastily to those members of the german chorus left on board up the dock and up the gravel driveway the big couple wove at the entrance to the arbuthnot the woman turned to my father and said with a controlled accent he vill need stitches ja of course you haf a doctor the deck manager whispered to father get freud stitches freud said the doctor lives all the way in bath and he s a drunk but i know how to stitch anybody the desk manager ran out to the dorm and shouted for freud get on your indian and bring old doc todd here we ll sober him up when he arrives the manager said but for god s
floor he sensed the auditorium walls shaking from the clapping and foot pounding that greeted the end of the speech from the rear he looked inside the entire audience was on its feet onstage virgilia stood with her head thrown back her exertions had loosened her hair and disarrayed her clothing but she was unconcerned her face shone with a dreamy exaltation with fulfillment he turned away sickened once outside he gulped air and relished the falling snow he would have to tell her she had spoken effectively of course but he also intended to take issue with her unfounded generalizations her performance deeply offended him not only on intellectual grounds but on personal ones it was true that virgilia was a grown woman in charge of her own life nevertheless to see his sister or any other female display herself so shamelessly made him cringe no matter what its veneer of propriety her speech had been an outpouring of sexual passion it had permitted her to say things no woman no man for that matter would have dared to say in public in another context what dismayed him most was his feeling that virgilia had reveled in the experience and not solely for the moralistic reasons she proclaimed but even if he put aside the personal considerations the shouts and halloos within the hall continued to upset him they showed him a dimension of the slavery quarrel whose existence he had never before suspected no matter how worthy virgilia s cause she had somehow twisted it an appeal for justice was transformed into a sordid even frightening call for a savage holy war there were warriors aplenty inside he could still hear them howling for southern blood on the train he had decided that all the sin lay on the southern side the side of the slave owners and all the destructive pride as well tonight had taught him a fearful lesson he was wrong in an hour he had changed his view of northern abolitionists for virgilia had surely taken her cue from other members of the movement how many of them were more interested in confrontation than in resolution of the problem how many preached hate instead of common sense he did nt condone slavery or excuse the mains because of what he had witnessed tonight but for the first time he believed there might be some cause for the mains resentment just as they claimed could the friendship of men from different regions a camaraderie born in shared hardships endure such terrible pressures was there enough good will in humankind and the nation to overcome the kind of mindless passions he had seen unleashed by his sister he shivered as wind driven snow flew at him beneath the marquee of the auditorium the storm was intensifying hiding the nearby lights of the town he began to perceive a future much grimmer than any he had heretofore imagined he had a brief dark vision of the country hammered by the slave question until it shattered like brittle cast iron difficult times surely lay ahead constance would help sustain him during those times and he hoped his love would do the same for her but as for the nation surviving the hammering finding the flexibility and compassion necessary to resolve the issue he just did nt know about that until this moment he supposed he had lived with illusion or ignorance now huddled against the wall beneath the marquee and unable to light his cigar in the rising wind he was staring at reality it terrified him a lehigh canal boat carried george on the last stage of his journey the canal followed the course of the river through the valley from mauch chunk down to easton the grand valley of the lehigh had been home to four generations of hazards george s great grandfather had left a job at a forge in the pine barrens of new jersey then the leading ironworking region of the colonies to strike out on his own in pennsylvania the valley had no huge natural deposits similar to the bog ore of jersey nor was there as much flux as the pine barrens men took from nearby salt bays in the form of clay and oyster shells but george s great grandfather did find great stands of timber for conversion to charcoal he found water power most important of all he found opportunity for years his was the only furnace on the river ore had to be brought over the mountains in leather bags carried by pack horses but that did nt deter him the same transportation system had served furnaces in jersey for a long time competitors said he was crazy not to move to the schuylkill river valley but george s great grandfather paid no attention and persevered in the valley of the lehigh he was his own master succeeding or failing solely on the basis of his own decisions during the revolution the hazards threw everything into the war effort and almost went to the wall financially luckily the rebels won and the continuity of the line was not abruptly ended by a hang rope but unqualified success continued to prove elusive year after year the hazards were forced to ship their iron down the river to the delaware in antiquated durham boats that were forever incurring damage on the rocks of the lehigh rapids then in the canal opened a local man josiah white had developed it principally to ship anthracite coal that had been discovered in the region but the canal boats brought prosperity to almost every business in the valley and hazard iron was no exception for a century products of the ironwork had provided the family with a steady if unremarkable income suddenly thanks to the canal many more markets were within reach and in one generation that of george s father the hazards were rich george had grown up with the canal the shouts
had five plus reverse and by the time he got to the central avenue light he was asking himself why he had nt gotten the rabbit with an automatic fuel efficiency was the answer is this worth an extra two miles per gallon ryan laughed at himself as he headed east toward the chesapeake bay then right onto falcon s nest road there was rarely any traffic back here falcon s nest road came to a dead end not too far down from ryan s place and on the other side of the road were several farms also dormant at the beginning of winter the stubby remains of cornstalks lay in rows on the brown hard fields he turned left into his driveway ryan had thirty acres on peregrine cliff his nearest neighbor an engineer named art palmer was half a mile away through heavily wooded slopes and across a murky stream the cliffs on the western shore of the chesapeake bay were nearly fifty feet high where jack lived those farther south got a little higher but not much and made of crumbly sandstone they were a paleontologist s delight every so often a team from a local college or museum would scour at the base and find fossilized shark teeth that had once belonged to a creature as large as a midget submarine along with the bones of even more unlikely creatures that had lived here a hundred million years earlier the bad news was that the cliffs were prone to erosion his house was built a hundred feet back from the edge and his daughter was under strict orders twice enforced with a spanking not to go anywhere near the edge in an attempt to protect the cliff face the state environmental protection people had persuaded ryan and his neighbors to plant kudzu a prolific weed from the american south the weed had thoroughly stabilized the cliff face but it was now attacking the trees near the cliff and jack periodically had to go after them with a weed eater to save the trees from being smothered but that was nt a problem this time of year ryan s lot was half open and half wooded the part near the road had once been fanned though not easily as the ground was not flat enough to drive a tractor across it safely as he approached his house the trees began some gnarled old oaks and other deciduous trees whose leaves were gone now leaving skeletal branches to reach out into the thin cold air as he approached the carport he saw that cathy was already home her porsche and the family wagon parked in the carport he had to leave his rabbit in the open daddy sally yanked open the door and ran out without her jacket to meet her father it s too cold out here jack told his daughter no is nt sally replied she grabbed his briefcase and carried it with two hands puffing as she climbed up the three steps into the house ryan got out of his coat and hung it in the entry closet as with everything else it was hard to do with one hand he was cheating a little now as with steering the car he was starting to use his left hand careful to avoid putting any strain on his shoulder the pain was completely gone now but ryan was sure that he could bring it back quickly enough if he did something dumb besides which cathy would yell at him he found his wife in the kitchen she was looking at the pantry and frowning hi honey hi jack you re late so are you ryan kissed his wife cathy smelled his breath her nose crinkled how s robby fine and i just had two very light ones uh huh she turned back to the pantry what do you want for dinner surprise me jack suggested you re a big help i ought to let you fix it it s not my turn remember i knew i should have stopped at the giant cathy groused how was work only one procedure i assisted bernie on a cornea transplant then i had to take the residents around for rounds dull day tomorrow ll be better bernie says hi by the way how does franks and beans grab you jack laughed ever since they came back their diet had consisted mainly of basic american staples and it was a little late for something fancy okay i m going to change and punch up something on the computer for a few minutes careful with the arm jack five times a day she warns me jack sighed never marry a doctor the ryan home was a deckhouse design the living dining room had a cathedral ceiling that peaked sixteen feet over the carpeted floor with an enormous wood beam a wall of triple paned windows faced the bay with a large deck beyond the sliding glass doors opposite the glass was a massive brick fireplace that reached through the roof the master bedroom was half a level above the living room with a window that enabled one to look down into it ryan trotted up the steps the house design accommodated large closets ryan selected casual clothes and went through the annoying ritual of changing himself one handed he was still experimenting trying to find an efficient way to do it finished he went back down and curved around the stairs to the next level down his library it was a large one jack read a lot and also purchased books he did nt have time to read banking against the time when he would he had a large desk up against the windows on the bay side of the house here was his personal computer an apple and all of its peripheral equipment ryan flipped it on and started typing in instructions next he put his modem on line and
trying to be slow with it so that i would tumble into the darkness as i d so often done with only the soul speaking to me yes telling me its secrets as the blood spurted into my mouth as i let my mouth fill before i swallowed yes brother i am sorry brother and then staggering forward i stepped on the corpse before me and crushed it underfoot give me the last one no resistance he stared up at me in utter quiet as if some light had dawned in him as if he d found in theory or belief some perfect rescue i pulled him to me gently lestat and this was the real fount i wanted this was the slow powerful death i craved the heart pumping as if it would never stop the sigh slipping from his lips my eyes clouded still even as i let him go with the fading images of his brief and unrecorded life suddenly collapsed into one rare second of meaning i let him drop now there was no meaning there was only the light before me and the rapture of the women who had at last been redeemed through miracles the room was hushed not a thing stirred the sound of the sea came in that distant monotonous booming then akasha s voice the sins of the men have now been atoned for and those who are kept now shall be well cared for and loved but never give freedom to those who remain those who have oppressed you and then soundlessly without distinct words the lesson came the ravening lust which they had just witnessed the deaths they had seen at my hands that was to be the eternal reminder of the fierceness that lived in all male things and must never be allowed free again the males had been sacrificed to the embodiment of their own violence in sum these women had witnessed a new and transcendent ritual a new holy sacrifice of the mass and they would see it again and they must always remember it my head swam from the paradox and my own small designs of not very long ago were there to torment me i had wanted the world of mortals to know of me i had wanted to be the image of evil in the theater of the world and thereby somehow do good and now i was that image all right i was its literal embodiment passing through the minds of these few simple souls into myth as she had promised and there was a small voice whispering in my ear hammering me with that old adage be careful what you wish for your wish might come true yes that was the heart of it all i d ever wished for was coming true in the shrine i had kissed her and longed to awaken her and dreamt of her power and now we stood together she and i and the hymns rose around us hosannas cries of joy the doors of the palazzo were thrown open and we were taking our leave we were rising in splendor and in magic and passing out of the doors and up over the roof of the old mansion and then out over the sparkling waters into the calm sweep of the stars i had no fear of falling anymore i had no fear of anything so insignificant because my whole soul petty as it was and always had been knew fears i d never imagined before the story of the twins part ii she was dreaming of killing it was a great dark city like london or rome and she was hurrying through it on an errand of killing to bring down the first sweet human victim that would be her own and just before she opened her eyes she had made the leap from the things she had believed all her life to this simple amoral act killing she had done what the reptile does when it hoists in its leathery slit of a mouth the tiny crying mouse that it will crush slowly without ever hearing that soft heartbreaking song awake in the dark and the house alive above her the old ones saying come a television talking somewhere the blessed virgin mary had appeared on an island in the mediterranean sea no hunger maharet s blood was too strong the idea was growing beckoning like a crone in a dark alley killing rising from the narrow box in which she lay she tiptoed through the blackness until her hands felt the metal door she went into the hallway and looked up the endless iron stairs crisscrossing back over itself as if it were a skeleton and she saw the sky through the glass like smoke mael was halfway up at the door of the house proper gazing down at her she reeled with it i am one of you and we are together and the feel of the iron rail under her hand and some sudden grief just a fleeting thing for all she had been before this fierce beauty had grabbed her by the hair mael came down as if to retrieve her because it was carrying her away they understood did nt they the way the earth breathed for her now and the forest sang and the roots prowled the dark coming through these earthen walls she stared at mael faint smell of buckskin dust how had she ever thought such beings were human eyes glittering like that and yet the time would come when she would be walking among human beings again and she would see their eyes linger and then suddenly move away she d be hurrying through some dark city like london or rome looking into the eyes of mael she saw the crone again in the alleyway but it had not been a literal image no she saw the alleyway she saw the killing purely
old james asked or is everyone coming here we re going to matt s jamie replied matt was the one who d started the dancing at patricia s birthday scarlett remembered her feet began to tap maureen smiled at her i believe there s a readiness for a reel she said she picked up the spoon by her plate reached across daniel and took his then placing their bowls back to back she held the tips of the handles loosely together and tapped the spoons against her palm against her wrist her forearm daniel s forehead the rhythm of the beating was like playing the bones but lighter and the sheer silliness of making music with a pair of mismatched tablespoons was cause for delighted spontaneous laughter from scarlett without thinking about it she began to pound on the table with her open hands matching the beat of the spoons it s time we were going jamie laughed i ll get my fiddle we ll bring the chairs said mary kate matt and katie only have two daniel explained to scarlett they re the newest o haras to come to savannah it did nt matter at all that matt and katie o hara s double parlors held almost no furniture they had fireplaces for warmth gaslit ceiling globes for light and a broad polished wood floor for dancing the hours scarlett passed in those bare rooms that saturday were among the happiest she d ever known within the family the o haras shared love and happiness as freely and unconsciously as they shared the air they breathed scarlett felt within her the growth of something she had lost too long ago to remember she became like them unaffected and spontaneous and open to carefree joy she could shed the artifice and calculation that she d learned to use in the battles for conquest and dominance that were part of being a belle in southern society she had no need to charm or conquer she was welcome as she was one of the family for the first time in her life she was willing to relinquish the spotlight to let someone else be the center of attention the others were fascinating to her primarily because they were her new found family but also because she d never known anyone like them in her life or almost never scarlett looked at maureen with brian and daniel making music behind her helen and mary kate clapping in time with the rhythm she was setting with the bones and for a moment it was as if the vivid redheads were the youthful tarletons come back to life the twins tall and handsome the girls squirming with juvenile impatience to move on to the next adventure life held for them scarlett had always envied the tarleton girls their free and easy ways with their mother now she saw the same easiness between maureen and her children and she knew that she too was welcome to laugh with maureen to tease and be teased to share in the bounteous affection that jamie s wife showered on everyone around her at that moment scarlett s near worship of her serene self contained mother shivered and suffered a tiny crack and she began to free herself of the guilt she d always felt because she could nt live up to her mother s teachings perhaps it was all right if she was nt a perfect lady the idea was too rich too complicated she d think about it later she did nt want to think about anything now not yesterday not tomorrow the only thing that mattered was this moment and the happiness it held the music and singing and clapping and dancing after the formal rituals of charleston s balls the spontaneous home made pleasures were intoxicating scarlett breathed deep of the joy and laughter around her and it giddied her matt s daughter peggy showed her the simplest steps of the reel and there was in some strange way a rightness to learning from a seven year old child and a rightness to the outspoken encouragement and even the teasing of the others adults and children alike because it was the same for peggy as it was for her she danced until her knees were wobbly then she collapsed laughing in a heap on the floor at old james feet and he patted her head as if she were a puppy and that made her laugh all the more until she was gasping for breath when she cried out i m having so much fun there had been very little fun in scarlett s life and she wanted it to last forever this clean uncomplicated joyfulness she looked at her big happy cousins and she was proud of their strength and vigor and talent for music and for life we re a fine lot we o haras there s none can touch us scarlett heard her father s voice boasting saying the words he had so often said to her and she knew for the first time what he had meant ah jamie what a wonderful night this was she said when he was walking her home scarlett was so tired she was practically stumbling but she was chattering like a magpie too exhilarated to accept the peaceful silence of the sleeping city we re a fine lot we o haras jamie laughed his strong hands caught her around the waist and he lifted her up and swung her in a giddy circle there s none can touch us he said when he set her down miss scarlett miss scarlett pansy woke her at seven with a message from her grandfather he wants you right this minute the old soldier was formally dressed and fresh shaven he looked disapprovingly at scarlett s hastily combed hair and dressing gown from his imperial position in the great armchair at the head of the dining room table my breakfast
good he could almost hear coal choking fourteen it hit him in the gut so hard he sat up straight and placed the coffee on a table fourteen fibbies out there flashing badges asking questions and it was just a matter of time before this thing got out fourteen you say sounds like it s pretty serious voyles was unyielding we re very serious mr president they ve been dead a week and the trail s growing colder we re tracking leads as fast as we can my men are working around the clock i understand all that but how serious is this pelican theory damn this was fun the brief had yet to be sent to new orleans in fact new orleans had not been contacted he had instructed eric east to mail a copy to that office with orders to quietly ask a few questions it was a dead end just like a hundred others they were chasing i doubt if there s anything to it mr president but we ve got to check it out the wrinkles relaxed and there was a touch of a smile i do nt have to tell you denton how much this nonsense could hurt if the press found out we do nt consult the press when we investigate i know let s not get into that i just wish you would back off this thing i mean what the hell it s absurd and i could really get burned know what i m saying voyles was brutal are you asking me to ignore a suspect mr president coal leaned toward the screen no i m telling you to forget this pelican brief he almost said it out loud he could make it real plain for voyles he could spell it out then slap the dumpy little wretch if he got smart but he was hiding in a locked room away from the action and for the moment he knew he was where he belonged the president shifted and recrossed his legs at the knees come on denton you know what i m saying there are bigger fish in the pond the press is watching this investigation just dying to find out who s a suspect you know how they are i do nt have to tell you that i have no friends with the press even my own press secretary dislikes me ha ha ha forget about it for a while back off and chase the real suspects this thing is a joke but it could embarrass the hell out of me denton looked hard at him relentless the president shifted again what about this khamel thing sounds pretty good huh could be yeah since we re talking numbers how many men have you assigned to khamel voyles said fifteen and almost laughed the president s mouth fell open the hottest suspect in the game gets fifteen and this damned pelican thing gets fourteen coal smiled and shook his head voyles had been caught in his own lies on the bottom of page four of the wednesday report eric east and k o lewis gave the number at thirty not fifteen relax chief coal whispered to the screen he s playing with you the president was anything but relaxed good god denton why only fifteen i thought this was a significant break maybe a few more than that i m running this investigation mr president i know and you re doing a fine job i m not meddling i just wish you d consider spending your time elsewhere that s all when i read the pelican brief i almost vomited if the press saw it and started digging i d be crucified so you re asking me to back off the president leaned forward and stared fiercely at voyles i m not asking denton i m telling you to leave it alone ignore it for a couple of weeks spend your time elsewhere if it flares up again take another look i m still the boss around here remember voyles relented and managed a tiny smile i ll make you a deal your hatchet man coal has done a number on me with the press they ve eaten my lunch over the security we provided to rosenberg and jensen the president nodded solemnly you get that pit bull off my ass keep him away from me and i ll forget the pelican theory i do nt make deals voyles sneered but kept his cool good i ll send fifty agents to new orleans tomorrow and fifty the next day we ll be flashing badges all over town and doing our damnedest to attract attention the president jumped to his feet and walked to the windows overlooking the rose garden voyles sat motionless and waited all right all right it s a deal i can control fletcher coal voyles stood and walked slowly to the desk i do nt trust him and if i smell him one more time during this investigation the deal s off and we investigate the pelican brief with all the weight i can muster the president held up his hands and smiled warmly it s a deal voyles was smiling and the president was smiling and in the closet near the cabinet room fletcher coal was smiling at a screen hatchet man pit bull he loved it those were the words that created legends he turned off the screens and locked the door behind him they would talk another ten minutes about the background checks on the short list and he would listen in his office where he had audio but no video he had a staff meeting at nine a firing at ten and he had some typing to do with most memos he simply dictated into the machine and handed the tape to a secretary but occasionally coal found it necessary to resort to the phantom memo these were always widely circulated in the west
had nt come yet tom had a hell of a time keeping charles distracted for two days and charles kept asking tom if there was any news from john taylor but there was nt tom was anxious to hear from him himself and he had only dared to call once and was lucky enough to find him in the office and taylor sounded exhausted hell man do you know what it s like to tear apart sixteen ships we ve torn up the whole fucking port what do you mean hurry up and they had asked for the same cooperation from the port authority in new jersey but it was easier for them all they had in port at the moment were tankers but manhattan was a snakepit and all the foreign ships were furious to be searched until they heard what it was about then they were a little more willing to cooperate but not much the news of teddy s kidnapping was old and in spite of the trial people had already begun to forget and stop caring and the inconvenience of a major search with all it involved was monumental they had even checked out the europa which malcolm was sailing on later but it was clean and the germans had been highly annoyed to have their ship searched i told you i ll call you if we get anything i have nt been in my office since last night and i only came in to take a shower because i could nt stand myself anymore you got any complaints mr armour taylor was sharp but tom knew he did nt mean any harm he was just tired no complaints just a nervous client tell him to keep his pants on we re doing our best and will you do me a favor he hesitated and then decided to ask him sure shoot what is it call louie the lover he smiled and taylor laughed no marielle patterson she must be a wreck wondering what s going on i did nt tell her about louie getting fifty grand to plant the pajamas i just told her we had a new lead i did nt want to get her excited sure what ll i tell her i do nt know taylor hesitated and tom found himself wondering what his interest in her was but he told himself he was too suspicious about everything he was turning into a real bastard just make sure she s all right patterson s giving her such a hard time he s divorcing her you know swell guy tom was disgusted but not surprised to hear it that s what i said he does nt know how lucky he is but i think he s going to get what he deserves with little miss krautland underneath all that blond hair she looks like one tough cookie may i quote you special agent taylor tom laughed and taylor chuckled tiredly in answer anytime counsellor you ve got to admit the little kraut looked cute on the stand though they both laughed and taylor went back to work reorganizing his agents they had already torn apart twelve ships and they had four to go before the next morning tom managed to call marielle as he d promised taylor is there something particular going on mr armour marielle sounded really worried i keep thinking they ve had some kind of information about about she was afraid to say it i keep worrying that they re going to find teddy s body i guess we should know if i do nt know which is worse not knowing or finally knowing that it s over either one sounded pretty awful to tom he still remembered finding out about his wife and the baby it had been beyond bearing but this had dragged out for so long maybe it would be a relief to finally know if he was gone instead of just having him disappear into thin air and never know it had taken them two months to find the lindbergh baby i hope we ll have good news for you soon do you know what it is they re doing he did nt want to tell her they were turning the port upside down looking for teddy i think they re just looking into some final evidence before we close it ll all be over tomorrow how s charles taking it actually tom leaned back in his desk chair and smiled she had a nice voice and he liked talking to her he liked everything he d seen of her during the trial but he had nt let himself think about her before except in relation to his client actually he s driving me crazy to tell you the truth that sounds like charles and then she grew serious again is he very worried as worried as he should be this new evidence may be of some help to him though we re hoping so anyway the fbi is checking it out for us we ll let you know if we hear anything at all thank you she was nt supposed to be on their side but there did nt seem to be sides anymore there was just everyone searching for the truth and for teddy the next two days seemed endless to her with malcolm away and john taylor gone to help with the investigation suddenly she had no one to talk to and with malcolm gone the house seemed unusually quiet it made her start to think about what she would do when she moved out she had nowhere to go nothing to do no family to turn to in some ways it worried her but she was nt as frightened as she might have been years before he did nt frighten her anymore suddenly she did nt care about him at all all he had done was hurt her bea ritter called her once
speakers stored visual material before a presentation he could lock his material away there in the lobby he passed the receptionist s desk now manned by a black security guard who watched a baseball game and nodded to sanders sanders went back toward the rear of the floor moving quietly on the plush carpeting the hallway was dark but the lights were on in the conference room he could see them shining from around the corner as he came closer he heard meredith johnson say and then what and a man s voice answered something indistinct sanders paused he stood in the dark corridor and listened from where he stood he could see nothing of the room there was a moment of silence and then johnson said okay so will mark talk about design the man said yes he ll cover that okay johnson said then what about the sanders could nt hear the rest he crept forward moving silently on the carpet and cautiously peered around the corner he still could not see into the conference room itself but there was a large chrome sculpture in the hallway outside the room a sort of propeller shape and in the reflection of its polished surface he saw meredith moving in the room the man with her was blackburn johnson said so what if sanders does nt bring it up he will blackburn said you re sure he does nt that the again the rest was lost no he no idea sanders held his breath meredith was pacing her image in the reflection twisting and distorted so when he does i will say that this is a is that you mean exactly blackburn said and if he blackburn put his hand on her shoulder yes you have to so want me to blackburn said something quiet in reply and sanders heard none of it except the phrase must demolish him can do that make sure counting on you there was the shrill sound of a telephone both meredith and blackburn reached for their pockets meredith answered the call and the two began to move toward the exit they were heading toward sanders panicked sanders looked around and saw a men s room to his right he slipped inside the door as they came out of the conference room and started down the hallway do nt worry about this meredith blackburn said it ll go fine i m not worried she said it should be quite smooth and impersonal blackburn said there s no reason for rancor after all you have the facts on your side he s clearly incompetent he still ca nt get into the database she said no he s locked out of the system and there s no way he can get into conley white s system blackburn laughed no way in hell meredith the voices faded moving down the hallway sanders strained to listen finally heard the click of a door closing he stepped out of the bathroom into the hallway the hallway was deserted he stared toward the far door his own telephone rang in his pocket the sound so loud it made him jump he answered it sanders listen fernandez said i sent the draft of your contract to blackburn s office but it came back with a couple of added statements that i m not sure about i think we better meet to discuss them in an hour sanders said why not now i have something to do first he said ah thomas max dorfman opened the door to his hotel roomand immediately wheeled away back toward the television set you have finally decided to come you ve heard heard what dorfman said i am an old man no one bothers with me anymore i m cast by the wayside by everyone including you he clicked off the television set and grinned sanders said what have you heard oh just a few things rumors idle talk why do nt you tell me yourself i m in trouble max of course you are in trouble dorfman snorted you have been in trouble all week you only noticed now they re setting me up they blackburn and meredith nonsense it s true you believe blackburn can set you up philip blackburn is a spineless fool he has no principles and almost no brains i told garvin to fire him years ago blackburn is incapable of original thought then meredith ali meredith yes so beautiful such lovely breasts max please you thought so too once that was a long time ago sanders said dorfman smiled times have changed he said with heavy irony what does that mean you are looking pale thomas i ca nt figure anything out i m scared oh you re scared a big man like you is scared of this beautiful woman with beautiful breasts max of course you are right to be scared she has done all these many terrible things to you she has tricked you and manipulated you and abused you yes yes sanders said you have been victimized by her and garvin yes then why were you mentioning to me the flower hmm he frowned for a moment he did nt know what dorfman was talking about the old man was always so confusing and he liked to be the flower dorfman said irritably rapping his knuckles on the wheelchair arm the stained glass flower in your apartment we were speaking of it the other day do nt tell me you have forgotten it the truth was that he had until that moment then he remembered the image of the stained glass flower the image that had come unbidden to his mind a few days earlier you re right i forgot you forgot dorfman s voice was heavy with sarcasm you expect me to believe that max i did i he snorted you are impossible i cannot believe you will behave so transparently you did nt forget thomas you
this excursion as if some signal period in life mine and his is coming if not to a full close then at least toward some tightening transforming twist in the kaleidoscope a change i d be foolish to take lightly and do nt the impulse to read self reliance is significant here as is the holiday itself my favorite secular one for being public and for its implicit goal of leaving us only as it found us free all of this comes in surfeit near the anniversary of my divorce a time when i routinely feel broody and insubstantial and spend days puzzling over that summer seven years ago when life swerved badly and i somehow at a loss failed to right its course yet prior to all that i m off this afternoon south to south mantoloking on the jersey shore for my usual friday evening rendezvous with my lady friend there are nt any politer or better words finally blond tall and leggy sally caldwell though even here trouble may be brewing for ten months now sally and i have carried on what s seemed to me a perfect your place and mine romance affording each other generous portions of companionship confidence on an as needed basis within reason reliability and plenty of spicy untranscendent transport all with ample space allotted and the complete presumption of laissez faire which i do nt have much use for while remaining fully respectful of the high priced lessons and vividly catalogued mistakes of adulthood not love it s true not exactly but closer to love than the puny goods most married folks dole out and yet in the last weeks for reasons i ca nt explain what i can only call a strange awkwardness has been aroused in each of us extending all the way to our usually stirring lovemaking and even to the frequency of our visits as if the hold we keep on the other s attentions and affections is changing and loosening and it s now our business to form a new grip for a longer more serious attachment only neither of us has yet proved quite able and we are perplexed by the failure last night sometime after midnight when i d already slept for an hour waked up twice twisting my pillow and fretting about paul s and my journey downed a glass of milk watched the weather channel then settled back to read a chapter of the declaration of independence carl becker s classic which along with self reliance i plan to use as key texts for communicating with my troubled son and thereby transmitting to him important info sally called these volumes by the way are nt a bit grinding stuffy or boring the way they seemed in school but are brimming with useful insightful lessons applicable directly or metaphorically to the ropy dilemmas of life hi hi what s new she said a tone of uneasy restraint in her usually silky voice as if midnight calls were not our regular practice which they are nt i was just reading carl becker who s terrific i said though on alert he thought that the whole declaration of independence was an attempt to prove rebellion was the wrong word for what the founding fathers were up to it was a war over a word choice that s pretty amazing she sighed what was the right word oh common sense nature progress god s will karma nirvana it pretty much all meant the same thing to jefferson and adams and those guys they were smarter than we are i thought it was more important than that she said then she said life seems congested to me just suddenly tonight does it to you i was aware coded messages were being sent but i had no idea how to translate them possibly i thought this was an opening gambit to an announcement that she never wanted to see me again which has happened congested being used in its secondary meaning as unbearable something s crying out to be noticed i just do nt know what it is she said but it must have to do with you and i do nt you agree well maybe i said i do nt know i was propped up by my bed lamp under my favorite framed map of block island the musty old annotated becker on my chest the window fan i ve opted for no air conditioning drawing cool sweet suburban midnight onto my bedcovers nothing i could think of was missing right then besides sleep i just feel things are congested and i m missing something sally said again are you sure you do nt feel that way you have to miss some things to have others this was an idiotic answer i felt i might possibly be asleep but tomorrow still have a hard time convincing myself this conversation had nt happened which is also not that infrequent with me i had a dream tonight sally said we were in your house in haddam and you kept neatening everything up i was your wife somehow but i felt terrible anxiety there was blue water in our toilet bowl and at some point you and i shook hands standing on your front steps just like you d sold me your own house and then i saw you shooting away out across the middle of a big cornfield with your arms stretched out like christ or something just like back in illinois where she s from the stolid christian corn belt it was peaceful in a way but the whole effect was that everything was very very busy and hectic and no one could get anything done right and i felt this anxiety right in my dream then i woke up and i wanted to call you i m glad you did i said it does nt sound like anything that bad though you were nt being chased by
asked for a piece of bread i am sure i am sorry for her but it is strange how much some folks must suffer before they are humbled pride must have a fall and it s best it should not but what i feel for her mrs hill s husband was too much used to the talking of his wife to give much heed to it on common occasions but he had tender feelings and the sorrows of his neighbour had touched his heart yes said he the lord knows who needs it and though i do nt profess to read the bible as much as you do that says he chasteneth whom he loveth and besides betsy i m thinking that it is not easy always to understand the ways of the lord nor safe nor charitable to explain his judgments does not the saviour say judge not lest ye be judged and how does he reprove his disciples when he says of those eighteen men on whom the tower of siloam fell think ye they were sinners above all the men that dwell in jerusalem betsy was checked for a moment albeit unused to hear her husband quote the bible but collecting all her forces any a text here and there but it takes grace to understand them now john do you believe any thing but pride could keep mary hollis out of her bed spinning and weaving till o clock by the light of the fire just to get a piece out of the loom to fit her children for sunday school when the ladies charitable society agreed to clothe all the poor children no no john destruction is sure to come after pride for solomon says the lord will destroy the house of the proud yes said john and establish the border of the widow and a blessing i believe is in store for mary hollis if every woman was like her it would not take some hard days work for you and i to pay our poor s tax this was an argument which had some weight with mrs hill far be it from me she said to discourage that people feel their situation if mary hollis had been like other people i should not blame her for working hard but never could i get one word out of her about her troubles she never owned that her husband drank that is never said any thing about it and many a time when he had one of his frolics i have been there to have a little neighbour like talk with her to tell her how much every body pitied her and that such troubles were not sent upon her for nothing she would say that what troubles she had it was easier for her to bear than to complain of and then she never failed to turn to talking about something else oh it is enough to provoke a saint to see any body so wilful john certainly did not think silence a provocation nor his wife quite a saint but his reply which perhaps would have had the return of little sally who came to say her mother would be obliged to mr hill to ask mr germain the minister to call at her mother s and her mother would be glad to speak with mrs hill betsy hill mollified by the expectation of confidence was not a little chagrined when she found all mrs hollis wished was to effect an exchange of commodities with her to supply the present necessities of her children she offered mrs hill her best gown the relict of better days for some pork and potatoes betsy was not thought a hard hearted woman but no occasion ever tempted her to discredit her sense by making a bad bargain and as selfishness is too apt to make us overvalue our own possessions her bargains were not always strictly just after a careful scrutiny of the gown and many remarks upon the damages done by time the present reduced price of goods c to all which mrs hollis listened patiently adjusted to the satisfaction of both parties it was a principle with mary never to beg while she could by any exertion or self denial do without it but no one could more gratefully receive a kindness the minister of the village was in the gospel sense the overseer of his flock his first duty he knew was to minister to their spiritual wants but that being done he did not leave the rest undone his benevolent heart was continually devising good and his strong practical mind contriving some mode for its application his wife was a fellow worker with him and the sobriety industry and order of their household were an excellent comment on the public preaching of the pastor no scoffer could ever say mr germain knew how to preach better than to practice no infidel could point you in derision to his family as exemplifiying the impotence of the principles he taught but a numerous family early inured to temperance obedience and love exhibited the blessedness of a well ordered household his people witnessing the effects of his wisdom had confidence in it and sought in all cases of difficulty in their temporal affairs his advice and many there were among them who referred the prosperity of their families to the salutary counsels of their beloved pastor the good man had anticipated the wants of mary and was already on his way to her when he met hill they naturally fell into conversation on mary s embarrassments hill said that a lone woman as she was and none of the strongest she must put her children upon the town that her husband though he was bad enough had contributed something to the support of his family but if his wife had not been the best christian in the world they could never have kept it together
of the wood mr lloyd had no family ties to philadelphia he preferred a country life not supinely to dream away existence but he hoped there to cultivate and employ a talent for doing good that talent which a noble adventurer declared he most valued and which though there is a field for its exercise wherever any members of the human family are he compassed sea and land to find new worlds in which to expend it mr lloyd purchased the place and morning of the sale by jane and her friend mary chapter iv she half an angel in her own account doubts not hereafter with the saints to mount tho not a grace appears on strictest search but that she fasts and item goes to church cowper the excellent character of mary hull had been spoken of to mr lloyd by his landlady and he was convinced that she was precisely the person to whom he should be satisfied to commit the superintendence of his family accordingly on the evening of the sale he sent a messenger to mrs wilson s with the following note robert lloyd having purchased the place of the late mr elton would be glad to engage mary hull to take charge of his family wages and all other matters shall be arranged to her satisfaction he takes the liberty to send by the messenger for jane elton a work box dressing glass and a few other small articles for which she will do him the favour to retain on account of the value they must have in her eyes mrs wilson had no notion that any right could be prior to hers in her house she took the note from the servant and notwithstanding he ventured to say he believed it was not meant for her she read it first with no very satisfied air and then turning to one of the children she told her to call mary hull to her the servant placed the things on the table and left the room so said she to jane who was looking at her for some explanation of the sudden apparition of the work box c so miss you have seen fit to disobey the first order i took the trouble to give you i should like to know how you dared to leave these things after my positive orders i did not understand your note ma am to contain positive orders and mary take the things right pretty judges of right to be sure she a hired a girl and a methodist into the bargain i do nt know how she dares to judge over my head and you miss i tell you once for all i allow no child in my house to know right from wrong children have no reason and they ought to be very thankful when they fall into the hands of those that are capable of judging for them here said she to mary who now entered in obedience to her summons here is a proposal of a place for you from that quaker that buried his wife last week i suppose you call yourself your own mistress and you can do as you like about it but as you are yet a young woman mary hull and this man is a quaker widower and nobody knows who i should think it a great risk for you to live with him you may be sure there is not a person in this town that wo nt think you are trying to get him for a husband mary was highly gratified with the thought of returning to the place where she had passed a large and happy portion of her life and she did not hesitate to say that she should not stand so much in her own light as to refuse so excellent a place that from all she had heard said of mr lloyd he was a gentleman far above her condition in life and therefore she thought no person would be silly enough to suppose she took the place from so foolish a design as mrs wilson suggested and she should take care that her conduct should give no occasion for reproach well said mrs wilson chagrined that her counsel was not compulsory it does amaze me to see how some people strain at a gnat and swallow a camel mary did not condescend to notice this remark but proceeded which she succeeded in doing without any further remark from mrs wilson who prudently restrained the exercise of her authority while there was one present independent enough to oppose its current oh mary said jane when they were alone how glad i am you are going to live with such a good man how happy you must be and i too mary and she hastily brushed away a tear i am at least i should be very happy when i have such a kind friend as you are so near to me yes yes dear jane try to be happy this foolish aunt of yours will try you like the fire but i look to see you come out of it as gold from the furnace keep up a good heart my child it is a long lane that never turns the friends separated but not till mary had with her usual caution carefully packed away jane s that it was best to put temptation out of sight mary s plain and neat appearance and her ingenuous sensible countenance commended her at once to mr lloyd s favour and she entered immediately upon the duties of her new and responsible situation we must now introduce those who are willing to go further with us in the history of jane elton to the family of mrs wilson where they will see she had a school for the discipline of christian character jane said mrs wilson to her on the morning after mary s departure you know
better fitted to make me the wife that i ought to have had than any that i ever met with her thought was like mine but better her ambition like mine but less terrible and more religious her more rational but as deep and as breathless as my own for her she is now married heaven bless and protect her reader it is all in vain i can not tell the story in any other way than as it occurs to my memory by fits and starts i can not preserve any chronological order i can only record my own associations bear with me chapter xiii hammond the dwarf sammy kelly confoundedly scared apparition unfinished sentence hammond s temper patience strength courage self possession readiness i have already spoken of hammond the dwarf it is now time that i speak more plainly for the hour is arrived when there is not an event of my life to be related in which he had not in some way directly or indirectly a strange wayward influence let me begin early when i first knew that i hated him it was in my earliest the spiteful little devil my brother sampson achilles otherwise called sammy kelly and of the life that i led at home such was my deadly antipathy to the creature at last that my blood would curdle if my flesh touched his much as if i had trod with my naked foot upon a toad the wicked readiness and dexterity of the imp are inconceivable i had ten times his strength and ten times at least have i saved his life when he was utterly at the mercy of some beast or carriage for not a dog would pass by the door where he sat with his tongue lolling out of his mouth and his long white fingers clotted and ringed with bruised and broken worms not a dog that did nt stop to bark at or worry him yet more than once have i been on the point i may as well own the truth of provoking one at when i was dragging him out of some puddle he was a beast a monster in all but intellect and that was instinctively devilish his seat in the door way on the steps in the corner of the kitchen was coloured with glittering insects that he had crushed and stuck to the floor or strewed all over with the hair of cats or the feathers of young birds that he had picked naked yet poor thing it was never thought possible that he could harm anybody and when i have been tempted to pitch him into a kettle of hot soap or an empty flour barrel for his cursed pranks upon elizabeth i have been withheld solely by a doubt that he might by some possibility have some sort of a rational soul or that he was too much of a devil to be hurt by it up to the hilt has he driven a little sharp pen knife into like a strangling baboon again and again has he blistered me with hot water and once it was well nigh the last moment of his life did he throw a crucible of melted lead at poor elizabeth when she was very little a part of which fell upon her foot and burnt and sunk into it till her shrieks could have been heard for a mile yet when i was only going to pour the rest of it down his own ugly throat some fool or other my uncle or father perhaps interfered and had well nigh poured it down mine for meddling with the poor innocent as if hot lead from his hand would nt burn a fellow but i taught him a better lesson at last he hurled a brick at me i just took him by the nape o the neck he had another in his hand which in his childish to throw into my face and eyes but i only took hold of his neck and he yelled out much as if a red hot blacksmith s vice had caught him there and dropped the brick never no never after that did he venture to lift his hand against me when we were alone i learnt how to manage him in some degree from that moment for idiot that he was he was not so very a beast as to repeat what he knew would end in pain to himself and but for elizabeth whom he tortured incessantly in one way or another worrying her with vermin and bugs filling all her little boxes and playthings with whatever was most hateful to her i should have gone on peaceable enough i have thumped him for it till he was spotted all over choked him for it till his eyes were starting out of their sockets but and the moment that my back was turned he would be at his mischief again growling all the time like a bear with a sore head about this time just when i had pretty well made up my mind to let the next dog that should attempt it throttle him at his leisure i happened to be out late of a holiday afternoon in a dismal wood dark and swampy and tangled where i had gone after black whortleberries it was already dusk i was alone and had far to go and withal was a terrible coward as i have already told you i was just clambering over a high fence i remember with the dish in my hand full of whortleberries and getting ready to leap when i uttered a loud cry and dropped them below me were a pair of large rolling eyes of frightful vividness it was a creature with a big head sa sa sammy dear cried i as soon as i could get my breath is it you sammy i was never so glad of
attempt her own life before she was twelve years of age and her beauty was so extraordinary that an agent of the royal government to the last colonial governour of massachusetts mentions it in one of his official despatches of the day as absolutely wonderful and miraculous he himself lived to see her a corpse she loved and the passion of love in such her parents discovered it she fled to the woods went among the indians was found almost naked and squalid with suffering and sickness brought home confined tempted but all in vain her last words were let me go free treat me kindly and i never will see him again without your consent but treat me in any other way and my blood be upon your own head they left her taking care to secure the doors and windows and removing all possible means of self destruction as they thought even to the bed cords and the bed linen and the glass but when they came to the door in the morning and tried to open it they found it fastened within they called it was frightfully still they burst it open she was found dead lying flat upon the floor with her face swollen and discoloured though very beautiful had she died who that ever lived could have done the same thing i have known one case like it since that of a man who sat down and leaned his throat against a rope until it strangled him a second was quite as terrible nay a thousand time more terrible than this it was the case of an uncle on his father s side his name was augustine he was a proud wayward melancholy man he was married and had five children he kept company with nobody and nobody knew whither he went sometimes for days together he would take up his rifle strike into the woods without giving his family any notice or preparing them for it by any symptom of departure no one knew where to look for him and nobody dared to enquire for he was known to have shot several indians and one white man under pretence of mistaking him for an indian a time of great peril to the white settlers at last he grew jealous of his wife yet nobody knew it till after his death for she loved him passionately though she trembled before him he was the handsomest man of his day i have heard several people declare who knew him tall square shouldered with an eye like the bald eagle and an arm like that of the panther at last he determined to die and that the woman of his heart might feel it he determined to die by the hand of her own children those very children whose legitimacy he never could have doubted if he had not been a madman for every one of them was the talk of the whole county round for his beauty and courage one day when his wife had gone to a neighbour s he put on his wedding clothes dressed himself with great care collected a great quantity of brush wood the whole with the driest that he could find and leaving a small hole just large enough to admit his body he then disposed about the cabin all the little pleasant endearing relicks of early affection that he had left and commanded the largest boy to go to the house for some fire the boy refused for there was something he said so frightful in his father s look that he was afraid to leave him alone at last however he consented and brought the fire that done the father kissed all the children embraced them all wept upon them all told them to be good to their mother and to love the baby the child then at the breast which was the real cause of all that he had done and then made the second child set fire to the brush wood it was all in a roaring blaze in a moment the pitch and rosin as by a flash of lightning the children fled screaming to the woods and the neighbours afar off suspecting that the indians were upon them blew their horns and mustered man and horse in every direction and kept pouring in to the rescue they found the wretched man and tore him out of the flames in spite of all his powerful resistance and half suffocating curses but he broke away from them again and threw himself into the blaze they were reinforced and at last succeeded in extinguishing the flames and dragging him out with a great part of his body burnt to a coal he could hardly utter a sound but the noise of cursing and bitter reproach was continually issuing from his whole chest which was outwardly consumed so that the motion of his lungs could be seen agitating and convulsing the cinders that still adhered to his whole body yet he did not were fools and deserved death to them and theirs for their meddling that he had been sold to his master who would call at eleven the next day for him that if they had let him die in his own way his body and soul both would have been consumed and the master outwitted the most remarkable circumstance after all perhaps was that precisely at eleven the next day he died but the other case in the same family was if possible more terrible yet and a thousand times more affecting one would be led to think that a judgment was upon the family for none of them seemed to die if i may trust to the manuscript in a natural way perhaps however it was only a constitutional predisposition to blood a derangement that led to bloodshed the last was the case of a younger sister whom i well recollect for the to the
of which she was terribly afraid arose and shook himself near her but he appeared instantly to recognize her and lay down again with a sullen growl she came to the gate it was fastened a thing that she might have known and she had not the power to unfasten it there was a hole cut through to let the dog out and in however and through that hole literally upon her face she finally squeezed herself her lover was at hand they ascended the carriage and were soon beyond the reach of pursuit search warrants under the state authority were taken out and the whole country was ransacked for her she fell sick with terrour and fatigue it was impossible that she could be married in that state and it was necessary in her timidity that being together and that they should sleep at least in the same room during her illness she recovered but her ruin was accomplished he spoke of marriage but perhaps it was fancy she thought that his eyes contradicted his words and she refused to marry him they lived together she bore him two children but the arrow of remorse was in her heart she besought a reconciliation she was accepted returned to her home but there was no comfort their very kindness was a reproach to her yet she bore it bore the solitude of shame and desolation for a long time till she was insulted insulted and desperate with passion she abjured her home forever and fled again to the bosom of her destroyer it was then that i met her she was delirious beset on all sides and ready to raise her hand against her own life i only one way i must acquire an absolute dominion over her i must make her love me love me better than aught in heaven or earth i succeeded but before i tell you what were the consequences allow me to relate one or two anecdotes it will show you the character of her mind and temper when quite a child she took her little sweetheart by the hand and journied with him all over the city after a man to marry them they met an aged friend please to tell us sir said she sobbing where the man lives that marries people the good man put them on their way in the simplicity of his heart without further questioning but they were lost it grew dark and she and her little cousin and her future betrayer all nestled and cuddled together upon some steps and crying lustily were found by an older cousin in the name of wonder said he children where have you come from what are you doing we have been to to to get ma ma ri ed was the reply the other anecdote follows she lived alone in a deserted house a murder had been committed in the next room she dreamt one night that the devil appeared at her bed side and bade her awake and get up for he wanted some conversation with her she was a good deal frightened at first though the devil was a handsome gentlemanly looking fellow enough but he bade her be quiet and assured her that he had no other business than a little chat with her she arose went into the next room kindled a roaring fire and the devil placed a chair for her in one corner and another for himself opposite he was quite said she i can not believe that you are the devil let s see your foot come up with your hoof he gave a sort of a whisk and put his hoof in her lap lord as i am alive so it is well you are the devil sure enough but after all quite an agreeable one so stop said he do you see that brick mark it she obeyed she took a nail and scratched it under that brick said the devil is a pot of money good night he arose and stood in the door way holding on by the top of the door which was partly open the light shone on his face it was very terrible in that room said he there in that further corner man dies every night at twelve o clock i come to meet him it is now nearly twelve she awoke a bright fire was burning in the next room where there was no fire and no wood when she went to bed there were the two chairs placed exactly as she dreamt she looked for the brick it was marked with the nail and the watchman that instant cried twelve o clock under her window she crept into bed in an agony of fear she lay there quaking with flashes of fire and smoke passing before her shut eyes continually until day light when she arose and took up the brick and dug till the foundations of the chimney were loosened and she expected it to fall upon her head every moment but she found no money and never slept in the house afterward i studied her mind i formed a matter of life and death to me she acceded i revealed it distinctly to the dearest friend that i had on earth but i showed her the letter no said she here is my last trial every thing in heaven and earth for me depends upon this throw i will never make it unless with the front of innocence if your friend know the truth how can i meet him he may not have the charity for me that you have he may have his friend too and my shame is publick the moment that i appear no abandon me if you will i have no claim upon you you have saved my life it is true and i am ready to lay it down at your bidding but i will never advance
from him for ever at a word me god i did not know it myself it was long and long after that i learnt it and then i dared not tell the truth he had married me because he saw my flesh lacerated my lips torn and my wrists stained with the iron that bound me i knew not the reason and i told the tale as it appeared to me gracious heaven will it be believed that my father had concealed the tremendous disorder from my first husband and that i a lunatick was married in the holy church to a man that loved me o i can not tell thee how fervently it was our hereditary disorder but my father was ambitious i had discovered this might not molton and if he did would he not avail himself of it to part with me forever and fly to thee the thought haunted me night and day before plot was matured jane and matilda and i prepared the infernal ingredients and thy husband stood by holding thy hand over them while a priest muttered his incantation juliet there were faces other than of this earth seen in the smoke of the church that morning and there were living creatures near thee as the benediction was pronounced and when that faint sickness of the heart came over thee i was there even i then i was secure but where when can the guilty say this cold sweats were upon me night and day edward waxed thinner and thinner every hour and every hour i felt as if my heart had been thrown into a coil of tangled serpents hungry and i could fancy that the blood dripped from their jaws continually like fire upon the wound many times i was ready to throw myself at the feet of edward and confess the whole of it and that he forgave me the cruellest thing of all only from discovering by an interview with mr grenville that weak as he had been in this affair nay wicked as he had been he was naturally a good man and well fitted to make thee happy i know that he meditated terrible things i know it for he sat up all one night and his face was tremendously stern and pale that was the crisis he forgave me it was after he had seen your husband but your husband died i am revengeful but i am generous my mother was a spanish woman i inherited her hot blood but my father was an englishman an honour to his country i inherited his lordly nature it was time for me now to do my part i thought of it long and long before the news of your husband s death came to me but remainder of that very poison which i had given to edward three years before that done i sent for him and told him all he was frightfully agitated at first but in a little while accursed thought it appeared to me that he was thinking already of his reward i could read juliet in his very eyes but witnesses were near and i told him in vengeance as much as in honesty that he had been the husband of a mad woman he affected not to believe me but the blow went home home i felt his heart stagger and heard the blood rush out of it as i whispered the truth in his ear pity me juliet pity me i was born for something better than i am pity me but i had written this all but the few last lines them i have now added while he and your and my girl is at the door all is now over they are returning one moment juliet i could have loved thee dear nay i do love thee even at this moment farewell farewell remember that my guilt is one of madness and of love canst thou understand it thou canst o how he used to talk of thee in his sleep it was hard to bear juliet but but i forgive thee and bless thee helen letter no iii enclosed this will be given to you my dear juliet only in the event of my death an event which i am sure is much nearer than either has been dreaming of read it therefore as the last confession of a dying man a husband too to his wife the father it may be of a babe already born to thee and to obtain thee juliet i permitted a system of cruelty and perfidy to continue long and long after i came to the knowledge of it for this my love my reverence my passionate tenderness for thee are no excuse but i had not the heart to break up a conspiracy and betray the plotters of thy ruin into thy hands while i saw so much probable advantage to myself in permitting it to continue nor is this all juliet i participated not only by my silence but actually with my countenance and behaviour for this i do repent me bitterly in dust and ashes this it is juliet that has troubled my sleep even at thy side this that has fevered and parched my lips and sunk my temples dimmed my eyes and turned my black hair gray within one little year what has it not cost me to conceal my own villany much that baseness of molton is false more of it is so discoloured and distorted that it is no longer the same and many times dear when thy tears have fallen upon my arm and thy bosom hath heaved unsteadily all the live long night when both were pretending to be asleep have i heard or fancied that the movement of thy sweet lips had the sound of molton in it and then i have been more than once on the point of throwing myself
moment with the the hewers of wood and the drawers of water to a patrician rabble and a profligate king but why was not washington pursued further the shores of the delaware were encumbered with materials for the construction of rafts and platforms and he himself in a letter to congress declared that nothing but the infatuation of the enemy saved him some have pretended to say that sir william howe was not seriously disposed to destroy washington but the truth probably is that he was a cautious commander knew not the strength of our army or rather its weakness and was unwilling to cross a broad and rapid river with a division that could could not be readily supported if washington should turn upon it supported by a general rising of the country sir william howe has been blamed for his circumspection burgoyne for his impetuosity cornwallis for one can hardly tell what any thing in short that would exhonerate his country from the disgrace of being beaten by be the best troops upon the earth yet after all there was something inexplicable not only in the movements of general howe and lord cornwallis but in those of washington at this time for the former but for the destruction of a little bridge over the raritan would certainly have taken our baggage and when the latter did not move from princeton until cornwallis was within three miles of it yet cornwallis consumed seventeen hours there actually sleeping on the way before he advanced upon trenton which is only twelve miles distant there is only one way of accounting for this cornwallis must have had positive orders and washington must have known it or becoming careless and desperate of the result which is possible even in washington he loitered upon the road and the enemy taking it for a stratagem were intimidated into extreme precaution soon after this general lee was captured and congress abandoned philadelphia it was a general not anticipate place yourselves with us in the boats my children imagine that you see archibald and myself holding our horses by the head with one foot upon the gunwale looking into the black deep water the enemy just coming in sight flash after flash shot after shot sent after us with a loud word or too in laugh and scorn from the enemy and now and then a horseman dashing at full speed along the bank before the torches it was a magnificent night but very dark except in a part of the heavens which were all on fire with a storm just rising the opposite bank we found in possession of a small body that had been thrown over in advance but such was our timidity for a while that when some fellow shouted the enemy we were all thrown into disorder for a moment without reflecting on the impossibility of such a thing there was a water and foam of the horses at windward as they fretted upon their bits and shook their wet manes in the wind blew in my face and when i landed wet through and chilled and stiffened in all my limbs i can not deny that somewhat of the generous enthusiasm for liberty which i had felt appeared extinct within me ours was the third or fourth boat and i recognized washington immediately and he my brother for he rode down directing him to form upon the right saying as he did so i have heard of your good conduct young man you have joined a sinking but not a desperate cause and i am sure that the brave men with you will live to experience the effect of their example remember me to every individual at your leisure and give me a list of their names where so many are leaving me the country ought to know who are coming in brother flourishing his light weapon in the wind as washington rode off how a few words from such a man as that can agitate a human heart brother i am no longer a boy no longer weak washington has spoken with me face to face and hereafter mark me i give way to no man upon this earth i was carried away with his enthusiasm and now being safe from pursuit we were thrown off into a separate covering party while the virginians saluting us as they passed with something more than a military feeling for had nt we been in battle together filed off in a contrary direction to join their companions the next morning at an early hour clinton joined us still with the air of a superiour in command and addressing my brother who was smoothing the mane of his beautiful mare said to him the commander in chief has confirmed your hundred men for a while hereafter they will be reduced at present they are too numerous for your command you have the liberty of naming your own officers my men shall choose for themselves said archibald no sir that will not be permitted the service has been too long the sport of that shameful practice it leads to indulgence carelessness and neglect of duty whom would you name arthur rodman said my brother bowing and jonathan oadley and whom you please for the rest your recommendation will be attended to said clinton facing his horse but i would have you know gentlemen that the eye of the general is upon you he expects the greatest vigilance and severest discipline you are now in service and subject to martial law there was something sarcastick in the tone with which this was said as if meant to irritate but my brother took had gone his manners mend apace brother but that arm of his seems wonderfully improved in camp i had observed that it was no longer in the sling do you know the surgeon that attends him no i replied he came very opportunely to the
through her redundant hair upon which her face lay half buried and pronounced his name a slight shivering followed and in a few minutes amid the dead stillness of all about she arose and sat up and put her two hands into his saying archibald i can now die in peace i have only waited for you and i lucia he replied kissing her forehead while the tears gushed thrilled and trembled with pleasure i have come to you for no other purpose than to to close my eyes archibald heaven bless you heaven bless you for it o mother do not break my heart upon the spot why will you sob and weep so distractedly is not this what i have always told you always have i not said father mother sister brother there is no hope god hath heard my prayer his hand hath stayed me i do not desire to live i do not deserve it he hath upheld me till now that i might see archibald dear archibald once more o archibald how i have wept for you and i said he in a solemn sweet voice like one summoned by something invisible dreading it not and ready to depart whenever it shall please heaven i dear lucia have wept let us be firm the little time that is left to us i what is there no hope none for you archibald said the dying girl kissing his hands with uplifted eyes and watching the changes of his face none dear none the malady is incurable i hush said mr arnauld have done with this my children it is impious vain and ungrateful you know not what death is coming upon you in stillness slowly and perpetually do i not said archibald calmly putting his hand through his brown beautiful hair and wringing out the moisture as if it had been the heavy march rain do i not it is not rain sir it is the sweat of death a night sweat that hath been upon me for more than a year i hush in mercy hush cried i know not what it is yet it seems horrible i have looked out in the vast desolate night in search of him i watched for what i thought his coming for with fear rose longing in my heart to know what t was which shook us all do you really believe sister said clara really and truly that there is no hope she was leaning over the chair of lucia about a week after the last conversation while i sat ruminating upon the awful events of the past archibald passed the window just as she was going to reply on horseback his motion was very feeble and wayward how unlike himself said lucia locking her hands when he rode by that window before he was younger by many years in reality he appeared ha how much younger but sorrow will have way and where hath she wrought so unsparingly as upon you do not believe the physician do not he may be an honest man a skilful one but i know better than he what that malady is whose approach is felt by the sufferer and known to be death i know clara that there is no help for me i would have you prepared for it i die of a broken heart i do not complain i can not many weeks many weeks may pass away before you are called upon to scatter the white flowers over my grave white flowers no let none be scattered there i see him see him two years ago he would have reined an unbroken colt as easy as i could direct the motion of that child s arm kissing the little fat arm of james while she spoke yet now the unmanageable creature bears him whither he will and how poor archibald brother brother i saw the movement of the animal but it was too late and i was unable to move hand or foot in my terrour till i saw archibald by a sudden effort which amazed me rise in the stirrups and throw himself off as the furious horse ran snorting and plunging toward that identical tree where archibald had been well nigh dashed to pieces years before a servant passed the window at full speed another and another with arthur and copely and we were left in the terrible suspense that followed for several minutes till we saw archibald returning on foot supported between copely and a servant he smiled as he passed her window and stopped signifying with a motion of his hand that he had something to say clara threw up the window do not be alarmed said he it was a childish notion i was i parted with him and he threw me it is a good lesson to me are you hurt dear archibald not in the least he replied wiping the sweat from his forehead not in the least i am to be sure a little mortified but i have been on horseback for the last time shut the window clara said i feeling the tears upon my cheek it is very cold and bleak abroad it is indeed said copely dashing his hand over his eyes indeed it is indeed it is said arthur and clara at the same moment at this time i was able to move with tolerable comfort about the house and after sitting where i was for about half an hour musing upon the beautiful face that lay before me her large waxen eye lids fringed with shadow and silkiness black them like some mysterious splendour about to break upon us and blind us her round and wonderfully beautiful arm lying under her cheek her magnificent hair all loose upon the pillow and her young bosom just undulating under the pressure of her other hand as if a hushed infant were there whom it were death

gratuitous curses by way of emphasis garnished the order discipline was kidd s creed and he supposed it was brought about only in one method the cat o nine tails had been freely used that very morning the yard arm was handy and the plank lay in the gangway ready at a word to be run out from the vessel s side at every springing of this dreadful trap a living corpse was heard to plunge and cries for help to come with the wind till the speed of crew to every various and rapid service which is suddenly required in preparing for flight and battle at the same time different orders were given in the same breath which were sometimes misunderstood and sometimes to his critical eye too slightly and negligently executed his orders had at first some few words of intelligible english mixed here and there among his oaths but he soon confined himself to his vocabulary of profanity which he fairly exhausted more than once in french dutch and english he soon saw that a battle was inevitable for the quedah from a long voyage was not in so good sailing order as the vessel in pursuit which was fast coming up i did not care enough whether i fought or run to make up my mind about it said he to bolton as he suddenly assumed an air of perfect composure but i think we shall be saved the trouble of a council of war on that point we must take in had their fighting rations let the quarter master bring some this way that i may have a word over a social glass with you mr bolton i like this chance of a battle if it was only as an apology for drinking though you may say i m not difficult about excuses but bolton to be serious we must be prepared you know for the worst and be the chance of our being taken what it may there shall be none of our being betrayed a conversation succeeded in a tone low but earnest in which nothing could be distinguished except at intervals such words the prisoner the plank he knows all and it ca nt be helped dead men tell no tales c the result was soon known without

seated on the deck of the martyr a young and what ladies would call a handsome looking man with a spy glass in his hand which he happened at this moment to apply to his eye i can not stop as the manner of some is to tell how he looked how his hat had fallen from his head and left it with no other covering than thick dark curls of chesnut hair which the wind stirred from his high fair forehead nor of the form that graced the rude ground work of the quater deck i must be if possible as rapid in my narration as he was in his action when his accidental glance assisted by the spy glass rested on that sight of horror which time worn manuscript must pardon me if i leave them to conjecture how he looked when he sprang on his feet and with a freedom of language which in those pure days even the profession of a seaman did not allow exclaimed good god they ve murdered a man away there to his help the hoarse voice of the boatswain was heard above the busy hum of the ship s crew away there

over him and in his drowning ears deep answered unto deep he had pulled the baudage from his eyes and it now hung loose about his neck so that he saw the effort for his relief and was struggling with the exertion of a spent swimmer to whom hope had given preternatural power when the barge was sweeping by him and the man in the bow caught the handkerchief round his neck with a boat hook the oars stopped and the boat with the body along side drove through the water with the headway already acquired the man was exhausted and lifeless to all appearance when they took him on board and put about

as soundly as ever he ll be thrashed in purgatory though i hae a notion that auld satan winna spare him yince he gets his claws on him we shall leave our love sick rustics to proceed on their journey and entertain each other in their own unadorned and homely style and direct our attention to edward barrymore who was as deeply enamoured as either of them and at that very moment anxiously pining for an opportunity to pledge his vows to the mistress of his affections but in order to proceed with his affairs we must open another chapter chap vii maid of the lovely rolling ah do not frown to hear me sigh nor do my faithful flame reprove for shouldst thou unpropitious be my griefs in secret shall remain ah never will i tell to thee what would the hallowed bosom pain thaunus the druid the reader will remember that we left edward and the recluse together in the cavern the old man reluctant as he was to part with our hero acknowledged the necessity of his speedily withdrawing from that part of the country since he had however innocently and unintentionally became an object of suspicion to some of the united irishmen the virtuous and more influential of them said he i know will oppose to the utmost of their power any attempt to injure you and will no doubt succeed in frustrating any such attempt if they only obtain timely information of its being intended but the framers of this confederacy have not been choice in selecting its members and the more wicked and abandoned of the wiser and more virtuous when they do not happen to correspond with their own passions and prejudices it is not therefore to be expected that the injunctions of o halloran or any other of their leaders will have much influence in restraining the violence of such men as darragh and his companion who would set the orders of their supreme directory itself if they interfered with their views at defiance my friend replied edward your good sense and the interest you have evinced in my welfare deserve my confidence i will therefore entrust the dearest wishes of my soul to your keeping it is now become necessary that i should leave this part of the country not only my own safety but perhaps the safety of one dearer to me than myself demands it for if i should fall who would then with the same solicitude watch over her and defend her from danger ah sir that i feel as if one of the strings of my heart were breaking when i think of leaving the part of the country where she resides and in times too like these when evils threaten her from every quarter should misfortune overtake her in my absence my only consolation will be a reliance on your prudence and friendship to afford her protection until i can fly to her aid promise me that you will give me frequent and speedy information of whatever may befal her and that when the storm bursts you will if in your power in this sacred asylum afford her shelter from its fury promise me this and the weight of anxiety that now oppresses me shall be greatly relieved i not only promise you this said the recluse but whatever else may be in my power to do for the safety and welfare of ellen hamilton will you consent to be the medium of any communications i may will replied the recluse without hesitation unless she forbids it but hasten from this dangerous neighbourhood for here there are active and malignant spirits aroused against you for your destruction farewell and may the almighty god of all things protect and bless you farewell father said edward and he hastened to apprise o halloran of his intended departure and to seek a farewell interview with ellen the early part of the morning had been somewhat cloudy and one of those gentle rains known among the northern irish by the name of may showers had fallen and rendered the atmosphere moist but not cold the day however assumed a brighter aspect and the advancing sun had dried away all the lucid pearls that had lately bespangled the tender springing grass the lovely richness of whose verdure has procured for ireland the appropriate epithet of the emerald isle with this refreshing verdure were intermixed innumerable multitudes of those simple flowers so sweetly described pale and violet blue lay scattered o er the fields the daisy pied and all the sweets the dawn of nature yields such fragrance in the bosom lies of her whom i adore ah gramachree c invited by
affairs if you preserve that woe begone visage indeed any other safeguard against the effect of your charms will be quite superfluous come my love cheer up and let me hear your sweet voice at my dinner table as sweet to me as minstrelsy to an old chieftain ellen made a vain effort to recover her spirits and then hurried away that she might indulge her ingenuous sorrow without giving pain to her friend she was careful to follow mrs harrison s prudent counsel and when george lenox came to friendly farewell message with the information that her duty to mrs allen precluded her seeing him again before the morning dawned george was in a stage coach on his way to the south he passed the boundary of lansdown with almost as heavy a heart as our first parent bore through the gates of paradise feeling like all true lovers that the world is divided into two parts that where she is and that where she is not it would be difficult to say whether mrs harrison was most gratified or disappointed by the result of her investigation into the state of ellen s affections while she lived her annuity was ample for the support of ellen and herself but nothing could be more precarious than such a dependence and ellen might be left to encounter alone the wants of life young lenox had promising talents and those getting along faculties that are a warrant for success his devoted attachment was merit in the eyes of mrs harrison still he wanted result of cultivation and those graces of manner to all which mrs harrison from her early habits and associations gave it may be an undue importance there is such a taste for learning we use the word in its provincial sense pervading all ranks in new england if indeed ranks can be predicated of a society where none dare to define the dividing lines and few can perceive them that we often see those advanced to the most conspicuous stations in society whose boyish years have been spent in ploughing the narrow fields of the patrimonial farm there are some disagreeable results from this state of things on the whole so honourable and mrs harrison felt that in implanting in ellen the tastes that belonged to the highest grades of society and in cultivating the habits of the born lady she had conferred a superiority of doubtful value and she was almost led to regret the fastidiousness which had been her own work when she felt herself compelled to trace who was her equal in all important respects and whose excellent character and flattering prospects would have rendered a connexion with him highly advantageous we said mrs harrison almost regretted the state of ellen s heart we fear she did not quite for in common with the best individuals she sometimes sacrificed general and immutable principles to the indulgence of her favourite peculiarities mrs allen s life closed at the end of a few painful weeks and ellen after having performed every service for her with the strictest fidelity wept over her with filial sorrow old mrs allen soon after joined her grandson at eton and ellen thus unfettered by duty returned to mrs harrison s where her life passed happily in pursuits congenial to her taste till she was summoned to vermont by intelligence of the threatening illness of edward allen chapter ix see what a ready tongue suspicion hath henry ivth our readers no doubt will think it is quite time that we should return from our long digression their notice till one evening mrs lenox entering miss bruce s apartment said ellen are you here and quite alone quite alone replied ellen miss redwood has not left her father s room since they took their tea i am glad of it glad the girl has the grace to stay with him even for half an hour though her society seems to be of little use or consolation and particularly glad dear ellen to find you alone i must interrupt your starlight meditations or rather give you an interesting subject for them but we shall want a light for i have brought you a letter to read a letter yes my dear a letter and to me the most delightful i ever received she was about to proceed to divulge its contents when both she and ellen were startled by a sound about miss redwood s bed mrs lenox advanced to the bed no one here she said i fancied i heard a sound i fancied so too said ellen happily we were both mistaken my dear for i should be very sorry to tell my story to any ears but yours ellen i am the proudest and happiest of mothers i have just received a letter from george which proves that he is worthy of his prosperity i am very glad of it and do you not yet ellen suspect the reason you have to be glad do you not know that george loves you oh i hope not exclaimed ellen involuntarily hope not my dear ellen i am sure there is not another in the world so worthy of his love not another who would be such an ornament to the station in which george will place his wife not another that i should be so happy to call my child ellen said nothing do not mrs lenox continued repress your feelings george like a dutiful son has made me his confidante and why should not you george himself can hardly love you better than i do thank you thank you mrs lenox no my dear you must not thank me you are worthy your good fortune and your own merit has secured it i have used no influence though i would have done any thing to have brought about the connection but this is george s unbiassed decision he confesses to me he has

was quite satisfied and tranquil but she was determined as she said not to come so far and spend so much time and money without having her pennyworth of pleasure the affair of the changeable had caused her but a momentary vexation the only indications that she remembered it were that she had carefully refolded and restored it to her trunk without one word of comment and that she never again appeared in that ambitious array if ever a shadow obscured deborah s good nature it was as fleeting as an april cloud the notice of mr redwood and westall which they seemed proud of bestowing was a warrant for her respectability and though the town bred young ladies thought her quite terrible and their beaus pronounced her a monster the lovers of the picturesque admired her figure with fearless curiosity with her holiday work her knitting in her hands she was sometimes seen surrounded by a group of boys relating to them a revolutionary story with all the animation of personal experience and her little auditors for boys are naturally belligerents would warm with the spirit of their fathers and long to fight their battles o er again she even attracted the notice of the french ambassador who made many inquiries of her in relation to the mode of agriculture and domestic economy of our common farmers and seemed so satisfied of the accuracy and intelligence of her replies that he condescended to record them in his note book but deborah s stable mind was quite unmoved by attention or neglect she inquired every body s name and learned something of every body s history she sometimes mingled in the crowd and took part in the conversation and sometimes stood aloof making her own observations in short she went up and down wherever she listed with good nature always obtained her sufferance and sometimes procured her attention and respect this was the posture of affairs when our female friends on entering the parlour one morning in their way to the breakfast room were encountered by the armstead party miss campbell sprang towards ellen exclaiming while her fine face witnessed her sincerity my dear miss bruce i am delighted to find you are not gone from lebanon i should have died with uncertainty and impatience the last five minutes but that i most opportunely met my friend charles westall at whom i have been speering questions about you which he answered as patiently as if he had been bred in the socratic school and to do him justice he asked as many as he answered but how comes it she added hardly allowing ellen time to return the kind greetings of the other members of her party how comes it that you have not mentioned our meeting and the fortunate incident that broke the ice of have thought of nothing else since at least it has given an agreeable hue to all my other thoughts you hesitate you were too modest to proclaim your own heroism oh my dear miss bruce the days are past when one might do good by stealth and blush to find it fame this is the age of display of publication however thanks to my generous interposition you have lost nothing on this occasion by your modesty i have told the whole story to mr westall every particular of it with a suitable number of epithets and exclamations and have had the pleasure of hearing him put all his ohs and ahs in the right places and with the right emphasis and conclude with a just like miss bruce but here she continued seeming at least not to notice the deep blush that suffused ellen s cheeks here comes the eighth wonder of the world the beautiful miss redwood and we common mortals entered leaning on mrs westall s arm her father was beside her captain fitzgerald joined them as they came into the room and they passed near the window at which westall and the ladies were standing fitzgerald recognised miss campbell in a dubious inquiring manner which expressed do we meet as friends and her cold bow replied unequivocally as strangers caroline turned towards westall your mother and papa she said have settled it that we take our drive to the shakers after breakfast you are no laggard and we shall depend on your being ready and do be so good as to get a direction from miss bruce to aunt the elect lady your aunt the elect lady exclaimed miss campbell no replied ellen quite unmoved by a stroke that was meant to mortify her i have no aunt among the shakers neither if i understand their order is there any elect lady said caroline it is this miss allen s aunt that i allude to perhaps she added still addressing westall you may persuade her to go with us as pioneer she must be quite familiar with the curiosities of the place and possibly she may favour us with an introduction to some of the gifted brethren poor emily blushed and trembled as every eye turned on her and edging herself behind ellen she whispered in all simplicity do tell her i ca nt go my dear emily miss redwood knows you can not go afraid of being reclaimed said caroline enjoying the confusion into which she had thrown the simple girl never mind child we shall do very well without you i will trust to luck for a chance to quiz some of the old broad brims caroline said mr redwood we shall lose our places at the breakfast table by this the ladies must excuse me i have an engagement after breakfast miss redwood bit her lips with vexation and then turning to captain fitzgerald
more deeply impressed on the heart for its instruction in righteousness a tablet of individual domestick and social vicissitudes would serve as a monument to recall the past and as a way mark to direct the future the record of our adversities is not easily forgotten but when the sun of mercy beams upon us we do not always like the israelites set up a stone of remembrance and say hitherto hath the lord helped us our beloved minister has departed full of days and full of honour four score and ten years were appointed him he spoke to us from the pulpit the tones of his voice were dear to me and his countenance ever restored the memory of scenes of happiness in which his friendship had participated or of affliction in which his piety had administered consolation how majestic was his presence he answered when he enforced the obligations of conscience and the terrours of the law he spoke with a power that forced the guilty to tremble with what an overflowing fullness would his mind illustrate points which the thoughtless had deemed of minor importance in prayer his solemnity was so striking that i think none could listen to him without revering that devotion by which he was inspired i have been peculiarly impressed with this my brother during the exciting events of our recent war in his humility for our occasional defeat his gratitude for deliverances his thanksgiving at the result he seemed to pour out his whole soul in all that variety of of the hosts of israel yet there were some who were fatigued with the length of his orisons and others who objected to the narrations which they contained the nurse of my niece who was a member of the church of england remarked that his prayers seemed principally intended to convey information to the lord were gabriel on earth he replied there would undoubtedly be some to object to the strain of his devotion i have heard our departed minister censured for credulity because in one or two instances he gave thanks for victory which afterwards proved a defeat but amid the variety of rumours which during our long war often deceived professed politicians how could he be expected always to discern between correct and false information he whose integrity of soul would render him one of the last to suspect others i have recently heard also some uneasiness expressed at the length of his sermons it seems that some of our office of an hour glass that they can ascertain the moment when the speaker passes the limit of sixty minutes all beyond is to them weariness and vanity they are not indifferent to any other species of gain but goodly pearls without price are scorned if they are presented in large numbers or in a capacious casket yet these cavillers are principally among the younger part of our auditors who have not yet attained the piety of their fathers they feel the winter s cold or the summer s heat more sensibly than the peril of their souls if the stoves and the furs of russia could be introduced into our places of worship changing an inclement season into the softness of spring i fear that even then they would scarcely listen without murmuring to a discourse of an hour and a half in length ah i fear that days are coming when sound doctrine must be stinted both in weight and measure and when it will be thought to destroy its specific nature so that there may yet be a time when the spirit of the gospel will be held secondary to the vehicle in which it is presented and men will hear sermons not for the purpose of laying conscience open to their power but to employ the mind in criticism upon their construction our aged pastor might have had the satisfaction of reflecting that he never curtailed the copiousness of his theme or allayed its pungency for the accommodation of ears polite to me she replied his performances were ever consistent with each other and with the holy dignity of one appointed to lead the sacramental host of god s elect and it has given me great pleasure in my visits to him during his decline to perceive that his strenuousness about particular doctrines had become absorbed in the sublimity of the great plan of salvation while we are ascending the hill of life little obstructions or aids seem of great importance sun of glory beam there the whole journey appears but as one path of light his happy spirit wondered where were the obstacles that had impeded its course they vanished when it sat so peacefully on the threshold of the gate of heaven this i have also observed my sister in recent conversation with him undoubtedly many of those opinions which we now defend with asperity will appear divested of importance when the light of another world shines upon them our clergyman seemed to gather gentleness and charity while he went downward to the grave as the sun sheds a more serene lustre when he trembles at the gates of the west i witnessed an affecting occurrence of this nature in the chamber of his sickness the divine of a neighbouring township differed from him in the interpretation of a particular doctrine and a dispute on this point had been conducted with considerable acrimony like the strife between paul and barnabas it caused a their friendly exchange of pulpits had ceased a meeting between them was effected by mr s the young colleague and successor of our departed guide they pressed each other s hands and tears fell down like rain brother said the dying clergyman raising himself on his couch underneath thee be the everlasting arms one thing is needful i trust that we both have faith in our redeemer and shall dwell together eternally where one spirit of love pervadeth all those who
there have been in my day said miss sandford in the squeaking tones of antiquated coquetry it was a toilsome process to please a lady when i was young but times are sadly altered now i dare say cain scolded his wife about the degeneracy of the ladies in nod said lucretia laughing lacking mortals she carried on her dangerous flirtation with satan continued somerville no one smiled at this speech for its levity was offensive to those whose associations with the bible were all sacred and to henry osborne the irreverence it argued was peculiarly painful anxious to interrupt the awkward silence lucretia hastily said my uncle left the servants with us but after all it seems that bonnets and hats cover brains of very similar formation for one by one the eagerness of curiosity tempted them from us till we were left to the protection of aunt sandford and really we have been much frightened added grace i had no idea the citizens of boston could utter sounds so terrific as those we have heard to night it would be well if their echo could reach across the atlantic observed her brother and what would be heard if they did asked somerville liberty and property a darkening expression passed over the fine face of somerville as rapidly as the shadows of autumnal clouds over the sunny brow of some verdant hill then you said he are among the unhappy men who encourage popular outrage and will thus drive the mother country to severity repugnant to her nature you talk sir as many others do who know nothing of the subject rejoined henry you mistake the unanimous voice of a free and intelligent people for the factious zeal of a few office seeking demagogues and what farther proof need we than james otis the aaron of your tribes the goliath of your hosts had his father been chief justice of the supreme court the world would have lost his fiery speech against writs of assistance as well as his never ceasing clamour about taxation without representation that is a common but most unjust slander upon the character of a generous and noble minded man he is disgusted rapacity for office which distinguishes some friends of the administration but he is too high minded to place the interest of his family above that of his country besides if avarice or ambition guides the course of james otis why is he not a tory the ministry would gladly buy him over on any conditions crystals would fetch the price of diamonds if they were as rare replied somerville england has quite too many great men to come and purchase in such a market as her colonies we have some however that britain herself might be proud to boast such men as adams hawley quincy hancock mayhew and otis would even there obtain the influence and reputation which talents joined with integrity never fail to procure from those who can appreciate them stop now dear brother said grace playfully putting her hand before his mouth governor hutchinson is coming and i can not never agree the shadow of the chief justice darkened the threshold as she finished speaking he bowed to the ladies with all the parisian gallantry that usually characterized his manner and after warm congratulations had passed between him and his nephew he inquired what news from england nothing new to you i imagine sir lord bute s ministry continues to keep the king unpopular among the commons chatham holds the people in the hollow of his hand and if his demands for himself and friends were not so excessively exorbitant a coalition of parties would no doubt be formed and he would be what he has long desired to be secretary of state and disposer general of offices and the queen and the young princes said hutchinson her popularity is unbounded she and her rosy children unite all parties prince george is as handsome and clever a scion as ever sprung from a royal root the duke of york is healthy and promising family group and the king is as gallant as ever i suppose too much so to leave three distressed damsels to guard a house on such a night as this i fancy said lucretia smiling nay said the lieutenant governor i will not plead guilty to that charge i left the servants with you and i knew the rioters were employed at a safe distance besides it would have been ungenerous in me to have deserted mr oliver if there was the least chance of being useful to him then there is your friend doctor byles lucretia it behoved me to inquire about his safety for we well know that his wit and his loyalty make him very abominable in the eyes of this liberty mad race mr osborne frowned and grace looked more grave than usual oh what a deal of scorn looks beautiful in the contempt and anger of that lip said the gallant chief justice floor but really mr osborne the scenes of this day and night must convince the most obstinate whig that the designs of the popular party in these colonies are altogether subversive of good government and must eventually bring ruin on the people i know not the extent of your meaning when you speak of the popular party sir replied osborne but of one thing i am very certain and that is that outrages of any kind have never been incited and will never be countenanced by such men as adams quincy hancock and whiting indeed it is worse than foolish governor hutchinson to trace the present commotions to the party spirit of individuals the truth is whenever government heap up combustibles a hand will always be found ready to kindle them and if it were otherwise they would take fire spontaneously and what damage has been occasioned by the explosion at this time inquired somerville cousin oliver upon
the waves of the sea beating from one world to another and i should know it by rason that i myself was fighting and baiting gentaly under wellington on the sunny side of the pyrennees in one month and the next comes an order and whips us off for canada in the twinkling of an eye among the indians and the yankees who know nothing about fighting he concluded glancing his eye at mr morris according to the civil rules of said mrs sackville i am grieved at her disappointment though i expected it oh do let us go in and see her said julia we will wait a moment my dear replied her mother her little boy must have told her that we were here and i think she will come out to us she ll not be right free to come before you said the soldier if as i now partly suspect you are the gentlemen and ladies that were so hospitable like to her the man now doffed his cap and stood with it in his hand with an expression of respect in his manner far different from the hostile air he had at first assumed but why not my friend come before us asked mrs sackville i trust she has nothing to be ashamed of ashamed no thank god it would be hard with her other misfortunes but though a soldier s wife she has an enlish spirit and a proud one and she says while she has her health and her hands she will never be seen asking charity and that destitute is her condition that as she said to day to make her case known to christian people is asking charity of them do mother let us go now and see her again interposed julia stop a moment my love replied mrs sackville and then turning again to the soldier you say she is utterly destitute but when she left us she said she had a considerable sum of money and she spake the truth ma am or what is the same she thought she did but a little limb of the old one saving your presence my lady had fingered all the poor cratur had been earning in three years in as many ah exclaimed mr morris who had been intently listening the son of belial i told you so i knew the rascal had it so dame barton said one of the gentlemen told her but the bundle was all tight and snug for the little devil had sewed it up again and she did not examine it till she come to look for the money to pay the captain of a schooner who had agreed to take her down the lakes and just think my lady at that moment what an overcast it was that mischief was done said edward as soon as he had an opportunity of speaking when you and i julia left that little wretch tristy in the wood i shall always think we were to blame for leaving him does the poor woman asked mrs sackville still think of returning to quebec to quebec ah she ll find her husband if he is above ground she is that resolute that neither wind nor tide can turn her if she was left on a naked island in mid ocean she would contrive to get off from it come children said mrs sackville we will just leave your father and uncle to finish their survey here while we look in upon our poor friend well go on mother said edward i will overtake you first i must run up to the flag staff and get at least a clover stalk for a memorial of the gallant brock who is buried there and i will overtake you too mother said julia falling back with edward the soldier s eye followed the children god bless them god bless them said he that is better than a monument what is better than a monument friend asked mrs sackville by an honest commendation of her children the memory of an innocent heart and a tear from eyes that never cried for sin my lady we soldiers die and are turned into the turf but we are honored in our officers farewell my friend i wish you well said mrs sackville dropping a piece of money into the soldier s hand and then turned from him while he was still uttering his hearty god bless you my lady julia hailed edward as he was bounding off towards the flag staff and begged him to stop for her as she had something private to say to him he laughed at her passion for secrets said he could not possibly be detained and at last good naturedly stopped to listen ned she said i tell you what i was thinking of as it was our fault you know that poor mrs barton lost her money and she little dick is such a good good natured little fellow i was thinking ned for mercy s sake think a little faster julia well i was thinking if we could contrive some way to have her go down in the boat with us contrive it could not take us long to contrive i think we can only ask papa you know and all the contrivance in the world will do her no good if he does not think it best but then ned there is one thing i would like to propose to father and mother if you are willing to join me do nt be so round about julia as if i was the great mogul speak out well then to speak plain you know edward you and i have each of us five dollars that papa gave us to buy canada curiosities with now i think if we were to club quebec if the captains of the boats are good natured men and reasonable in their charges
greatly relieving it would seem that while his own surprise had been anticipated and had consequently failed the enemy in their turn having been deceived in its object and in his numbers had left too small a force to resist the impetuous onset of the young mohican this fact was doubly apparent by the rapid manner in which the battle in the forest rolled upward toward the village and by an instant falling off in the number of their assailants who rushed to assist in maintaining the front and as it now proved to be the principal point of defense animating his followers by his voice and his own example hawkeye then gave the word to bear down upon their foes the charge in that rude species of warfare consisted merely in pushing from cover to cover nigher to the enemy and in this maneuver he was instantly and successfully obeyed the hurons were compelled to withdraw and the scene of the contest rapidly changed from to a spot where the assailed found a thicket to rest upon here the struggle was protracted arduous and seemingly of doubtful issue the delawares though none of them fell beginning to bleed freely in consequence of the disadvantage at which they were held in this crisis hawkeye found means to get behind the same tree as that which served for a cover to heyward most of his own combatants being within call a little on his right where they maintained rapid though fruitless discharges on their sheltered enemies you are a young man major said the scout dropping the butt of killdeer to the earth and leaning on the barrel a little fatigued with his previous industry and it may be your gift to lead armies at some future day ag in these imps the mingoes you may here see the philosophy of an indian fight it consists mainly in ready hand a quick eye and a good cover royal americans here in what manner would you set them to work in this business the bayonet would make a road ay there is white reason in what you say but a man must ask himself in this wilderness how many lives he can spare no horse continued the scout shaking his head like one who mused horse i am ashamed to say must sooner or later decide these scrimmages the brutes are better than men and to horse must we come at last put a shodden hoof on the moccasin of a red skin and if his rifle be once emptied he will never stop to load it again the american forest admits of the passage of horses there being little underbrush and few tangled brakes the plan of hawkeye is the one which has always proved the most successful in the battles between the whites and the indians wayne in his celebrated campaign on the miami received causing his dragoons to wheel round his flanks the indians were driven from their covers before they had time to load one of the most conspicuous of the chiefs who fought in the battle of miami assured the writer that the red men could not fight the warriors with long knives and leather stockings meaning the dragoons with their sabers and boots this is a subject that might better be discussed at another time returned heyward shall we charge i see no contradiction to the gifts of any man in passing his breathing spells in useful reflections the scout replied as to rush i little relish such a measure for a scalp or two must be thrown away in the attempt and yet he added bending his head aside to catch the sounds of the distant combat if we are to be of use to uncas these knaves in our front must be got rid of then turning with his indians in their own language his words were answered by a shout and at a given signal each warrior made a swift movement around his particular tree the sight of so many dark bodies glancing before their eyes at the same instant drew a hasty and consequently an ineffectual fire from the hurons without stopping to breathe the delawares leaped in long bounds toward the wood like so many panthers springing upon their prey hawkeye was in front brandishing his terrible rifle and animating his followers by his example a few of the older and more cunning hurons who had not been deceived by the artifice which had been practiced to draw their fire now made a close and deadly discharge of their pieces and justified the apprehensions of the scout by felling three of his foremost warriors but the shock was insufficient to repel the impetus of the charge the delawares broke into the cover with the ferocity of their natures and swept away every trace of resistance by the fury instant hand to hand and then the assailed yielded ground rapidly until they reached the opposite margin of the thicket where they clung to the cover with the sort of obstinacy that is so often witnessed in hunted brutes at this critical moment when the success of the struggle was again becoming doubtful the crack of a rifle was heard behind the hurons and a bullet came whizzing from among some beaver lodges which were situated in the clearing in their rear and was followed by the fierce and appalling yell of the war whoop there speaks the sagamore shouted hawkeye answering the cry with his own stentorian voice we have them now in face and back the effect on the hurons was instantaneous discouraged by an assault from a quarter that left them no opportunity for cover the warriors uttered a common yell of disappointment and breaking off in a body they spread themselves across the opening heedless of every consideration but flight many and the blows of the pursuing delawares we shall not pause to detail the meeting between the scout
of some uncovered corse he grew fainter and fainter a dead weight like iron was on his brain the remembrance of even his situation was only created things was nearly lost but once again his faculties appeared renewed and he looked fearfully from side to side he gazed upon the arms of a mighty tree that waved in the wind above him and by his distorting vision seemed tottering to a fall he wished that the falling timber might crush and release him from his misery he revelled in the thought for it seemed as though connexion with the living was broken and he retained no human or earthly ties his senses swam and his eyes now weakened to exhaustion closed as it were from mere pain and then there came a voice close to his ear as from the lips of his comrade yet he scarce heard it for his limbs grew motionless stiff like with the ice of death a very slumber tranquil and senseless was on him when sudden a sound sharp and loud startled him and he awoke the noise petrified his very frame but although he strived at when again it was repeated such was the joy and surprise that pervaded him that he had almost relapsed into his former helplessness for it was the report of a gun followed by the deep mouthed baying of a wolf dog that even in its roughness came as sweet to his ears as music to the listening sick in an instant all weakness was fled his intellectual powers returned with increased vigour and acuteness and appeared to vie with each other while as he shouted every nerve trembled with agitation and fear lest the succour should not be real but a mere deception of the sense and as soon as the call was echoed by the cheerful voice of man the blood rushed back in a torrent to the heart as with the joyful bound of a stag and he sunk down overcome by fatigue and agitation thank heaven we are saved we are saved burst joyfully from his lips as he beheld his comrades revived and starting answer was twice repeated to his call at a short space of time a large dog sprang through the thicket and with fierce and malicious barkings darted towards them but his ferocity was soon soothed to silence by the appearance of a savage looking man who followed down luath down thou noisy hound said the stranger and the animal passive and obedient ran fawning about him a lanthorn which the man bore in one hand by its strong yet transient gleams discovered to the party his singular grim and haggard visage overrun by a grey and grisly beard which appeared to have been long unshorn he was as well as could be distinguished a tall gaunt bony figure with sinews and muscle that indicated almost gigantic strength a buckskin hunting shirt dressed with the hair outward hung half way between the hip and knee and was tied round his waist with a leathern thong his legs were covered with stockings of blanket on his head he wore a cap made of the hide of some wild animal but dyed of a scarlet colour after the manner of the indian and in one hand he held a long barrelled spanish musquetoon a hatchet and knife bared to the handle and glittering in the red light were stuck in the thong which bound his garments he greeted the benighted and perishing travellers in a voice the roughness of whose tone was strongly contrasted with the kindness intended and after a few inquiries of their distress which was briefly conveyed to him as much by their appearance as words he proceeded to state that if their strengths could support it he would conduct them where not many paces distant several of his companions hunters who had been bewildered also in the snow storm in the far pursuit of game had been enabled to build their watch fire within the shelter of a ruined and deserted hut and in their name he offered a share of the succour and scanty the tempest mustering up cheerfully at this speedy chance of relief their remaining spirit they blessed him for his proffered hospitality and with an activity scarcely to be expected from their worn and weakened frames they hastily prepared to follow the leading of the stranger mien got dou gant leive mien merrie behind cried vanderspeigl in a piteous tone after having endeavoured to arouse the quadruped

own soul i have no reason to doubt my son s filial obedience he hath never been wanting and though both he and i have fallen under censure i see not that i erred in sending him from me since i but

magnanimous conflict with necessary evils involve themselves in superfluous trials whatever gratified the natural desires of the heart was questionable and almost every thing that was difficult and painful assumed the form of duty as if the benevolent father of all had stretched over our heads a canopy of clouds instead of the bright firmament and its glorious host and ever changing beauty and had spread under our feet a wilderness of bitter herbs instead of every tree and plant yielding its good fruit but we would fix our eyes on the bright halo that encircled the pilgrims head and not

halleck the observance of the sabbath began with the puritans as it still does night at the going down of the sun on saturday all temporal affairs were suspended and so zealously did our fathers maintain the letter as well as the spirit of the law that according to a vulgar tradition in connecticut no beer was brewed in the latter part of the week lest it should presume to work on sunday it must be confessed that the tendency of the age is to laxity and so rapidly is the wholesome strictness of primitive times abating that should some antiquary fifty years hence in exploring his garret rubbish chance to cast his eye on our humble pages he may be surprised to learn that even now the sabbath is observed in the interior of new england with an almost judaical severity on saturday afternoon an uncommon bustle is apparent the great class of procrastinators are hurrying to and fro to complete the lagging business of the week the good mothers like burns matron are plying their needles making while the domestics or help we prefer the national descriptive term are wielding with might and main their brooms and mops to make all tidy for the sabbath as the day declines the hum of labour dies away and after the sun is set perfect stillness reigns in every well ordered household and not a foot fall is heard in the village street it can not be denied that even the most spiritual missing the excitement of their ordinary occupations anticipate their usual bed time the obvious inference from this fact is skilfully avoided by certain ingenious reasoners who allege that the constitution was originally so organised as to require an extra quantity of sleep on every seventh night we recommend it to the curious to inquire how this peculiarity was adjusted when the first day of the week was changed from saturday to sunday the sabbath morning is as peaceful as the first hallowed day not a human sound is heard without the dwellings crowing of the cocks and the gossipping of the birds animal life would seem to be extinct till at the bidding of the church going bell the old and young issue from their habitations and with solemn demeanor bend their measured steps to the meeting house the family of the minister the squire the doctor the merchants the modest gentry of the village and the mechanic and labourer all arranged in their best all meeting on even ground and all with that consciousness of independence and equality which breaks down the pride of the rich and rescues the poor from servility envy and discontent if a morning salutation is reciprocated it is in a suppressed voice and if perchance nature in some reckless urchin burst forth in laughter my dear you forget it s sunday is the ever ready reproof though every face wears a solemn aspect yet we once chanced to see even a deacon s muscles relaxed by in a half deprecating half laughing voice the squire is so droll that a body must laugh though it be sabbath day the farmer s ample waggon and the little one horse vehicle bring in all who reside at an inconvenient walking distance that is to say in our riding community half a mile from the church it is a pleasing sight to those who love to note the happy peculiarities of their own land to see the farmer s daughters blooming intelligent and well bred pouring out of these homely coaches with their nice white gowns prunel shoes leghorn hats fans and parasols and the spruce young men with their plaited ruffles blue coats and yellow buttons the whole community meet as one religious family to offer their devotions at the common altar if there is an out law from the society a luckless wight whose vagrant taste has never been subdued he may be seen stealing along the margin of some and troublesome admonitions of his fellows towards the close of the day or to borrow a phrase descriptive of his feelings who first used it when the sabbath begins to abate the children cluster about the windows their eyes wander from their catechisms to the western sky and though it seems to them as if the sun would never disappear his broad disk does slowly sink behind the mountain and while his last ray still lingers on the

wrapped her in his cloak and assisted by his father carried her in his arms to the nearest habitation whence she was conveyed as soon as a carriage could be obtained to governor winthrop s chapter vii he that questions whether god made the world the indian will teach him i must acknowledge i have received in my converse with them many confirmations of those two great points first that god is second that he is a rewarder of all them that diligently seek him roger williams our readers sagacity has probably enabled them to penetrate the slight mystery in which the circumstances that led to the apprehension of magawisca have been shrouded sir philip gardiner after attending the history of our heroine saw her enter the burial place partly moved by his desire to ascertain whether there was any cause for her running away from him that might soothe his vanity and partly no doubt by an irresistible attraction towards her he followed at a prudent distance till he saw her meeting with magawisca he then secreted himself in the thicket of evergreens where he was near enough to hear and observe all that passed and where as may be remembered he narrowly escaped being exposed by his dog sir philip had heard the rumour of a conspiracy among the natives and when he saw magawisca s extreme anxiety to secure a clandestine interview with miss leslie the probable reason for her secresy at once occurred to him if he conjectured rightly he was in possession of a secret that might be of value to the state and of course be made the means of advancing him in the favour of the governor but might he not risk incurring and thus forfeit the object of all his present thoughts and actions he believed not he saw that she yielded reluctantly and because she had no alternative to magawisca s imposition of secresy with her romantic notions it was most probable that she would hold her promise inviolate but would she not be bound in everlasting gratitude to him who by an ingenious manoeuvre should without in the least involving her honour secure the recovery of her sister thus he flattered himself he should in any event obtain some advantage to miss leslie he would appear solely actuated by zeal for her happiness to the governor by devotion to the safety and welfare of the commonwealth accordingly on the following monday morning he solicited a private interview with the magistrates and deposed before them that on returning to his lodgings on saturday night he had seen miss leslie enter the burying ground alone that believing she had gone to visit some spot consecrated by the interment of young lady he feared she might forget in the indulgence of her feelings the lateness of the hour he had therefore with the intention of guarding her from all harm without intruding on her meditations which though manifestly unseasonable might he thought tend to edifying by withdrawing her thoughts from worldly objects followed her and secluded himself in the copse of evergreens where to his astonishment he had witnessed her interview with the indian woman the particulars of their conversation he gave at length unfortunately for magawisca sir philip s testimony coincided with the story of a renegado indian formerly one of the counsellors and favourites of maintunnomoh this savage stung by some real or fancied wrongs deserted his tribe and vowing revenge he repaired to boston and divulged to the governor the secret hostility of his chief towards the english which he said had been stimulated to activity by the old pequod chief and the renowned maiden the different tribes moved by the eloquence and arguments of mononotto were forming a powerful combination thus far the treacherous savage told the truth but he proceeded to state plots and underplots and artfully to exaggerate the number and power of the tribes the magistrates lent a believing ear to the whole story they were aware that the narragansetts ever since they had witnessed the defeat and extinction of their ancient enemies the pequods had felt a secret dread and jealousy of the power and encroachments of the english and that they only waited for an opportunity to manifest their hostility letters had been recently received from the magistrates of connecticut expressing their belief that a general rising of the indians was meditated all these circumstances combined to give importance to sir philip s and the indian s communications but the governor felt the necessity of proceeding warily miantunnomoh had been the faithful friend and ally of the english he is described by winthrop as a sagacious and subtle man who showed and ingenuity withal such a man it was obviously the policy of the english not unnecessarily to provoke and the governor hoped by getting possession of the pequod family to obtain the key to miantunnomoh s real designs and to crush the conspiracy before it was matured we have been compelled to this digression in order to explain the harsh reception and treatment of magawisca to account for the zeal with which the governor promoted the party to the garden and for the signal which guided the boat directly to the pequod family and which sir philip remained on the island to give the knight had now gotten very deep into the councils and favour of the magistrates who saw in him the selected medium of a special kindness of providence to them he took good care that all his circling wiles should end in feigned religion smooth hypocrisy and by addressing his arts to the predominant tastes and principles of the honest men whom he deluded he well sustained his describe the various emotions of governor winthrop s family at the return of hope leslie madam winthrop over excited by the previous events of the evening had fortunately escaped any further agitation by retiring to bed after composing her nerves with a
untimely death involved the son in considerable uncertainty with regard to his sister s fate his anxiety on this account induced him to seize the first conveyance that offered in a short time he landed at baltimore as soon as he recovered from the fatigues of his voyage he prepared to go to philadelphia thither his baggage was immediately sent under the protection of a passenger and countryman his money consisted in portuguese gold which in pursuance of advice he had changed into bank notes he besought me in pathetic terms to search out his sister whose youth and poverty and ignorance of the language and manners of the country might expose her to innumerable hardships book and small volume into my hand indicating by his countenance and gestures his desire that i would deliver them to his sister his obsequies being decently performed i had leisure to reflect upon the change in my condition which this incident had produced in the pocket book were found bills to the amount of twenty thousand dollars the volume proved to be a manuscript written by the elder lodi in italian and contained memoirs of the ducal house of visconti from whom the writer believed himself to have lineally descended thus had i arrived by an avenue so much beyond my foresight at the possession of wealth the evil which impelled me to the brink of suicide and which was the source though not of all yet of the larger portion of my anguish was now removed what claims to honor or to ease were consequent on riches were by an extraordinary fortune now conferred upon me such for a time were my money was not mine that it had been received under every sanction of fidelity for another s use to retain it was equivalent to robbery the sister of the deceased was the rightful claimant it was my duty to search her out and perform my tacit but sacred obligations by putting the whole into her possession this conclusion was too adverse to my wishes not to be strenuously combated i asked what it was that gave man the power of ascertaining the successor to his property during his life he might transfer the actual possession but if vacant at his death he into whose hands accident should cast it was the genuine proprietor it is true that the law had sometimes otherwise decreed but in law there was no validity further than it was able by investigation and punishment to enforce its decrees but would the law extort this money from me it was rather by gesture than by words that the will remote inferences and vague conjecture rather than of explicit and unerring declarations besides if the lady were found would not prudence dictate the reservation of her fortune to be administered by me for her benefit of this her age and education had disqualified herself it was sufficient for the maintenance of both she would regard me as her benefactor and protector by supplying all her wants and watching over her safety without apprizing her of the means by which i shall be enabled to do this i shall lay irresistible claims to her love and her gratitude such were the sophistries by which reason was seduced and my integrity annihilated i hastened away from my present abode i easily traced the baggage of the deceased to an inn and gained possession of it it contained nothing but clothes and books i then instituted the most diligent search after the young lady for a time my exertions were fruitless meanwhile the possessor of this house thought proper to embark with for his furniture though enormous was precipitately paid by me his servants were continued in their former stations and in the day at which he relinquished the mansion i entered on possession there was no difficulty in persuading the world that welbeck was a personage of opulence and rank my birth and previous adventures it was proper to conceal the facility with which mankind are misled in their estimate of characters their proneness to multiply inferences and conjectures will not be readily conceived by one destitute of my experience my sudden appearance on the stage my stately reserve my splendid habitation and my circumspect deportment were sufficient to entitle me to homage the artifices that were used to unveil the truth and the guesses that were current respecting me were adapted to gratify my ruling passion i did not remit my diligence to discover the retreat of mademoiselle lodi i found her at length in the family of a kinsman of the captain under whose care she had she had already experienced the evils of being protectorless and indigent and my seasonable interference snatched her from impending and less supportable ills i could safely unfold all that i knew of her brother s history except the legacy which he had left i ascribed the diligence with which i had sought her to his death bed injunctions and prevailed upon her to accept from me the treatment which she would have received from her brother if he had continued to live and if his power to benefit had been equal to my own though less can be said in praise of the understanding than of the sensibilities of this woman she is one whom no one could refrain from loving though placed in situations far less favorable to the generation of that sentiment than mine in habits of domestic and incessant intercourse in the perpetual contemplation of features animated by boundless gratitude and ineffable sympathies it could not be expected that either she or i should escape enchantment the poison me too late i remembered that i was already enslaved by inextricable obligations it was easy to have hidden this impediment from the eyes of my companion but here my integrity refused to yield i can indeed lay claim to little merit on account of this forbearance if there
s qualities he was more prone to shrink from danger than encounter it and to yield to the flood rather than sustain it but it is just to observe that his anguish on the present occasion arose not wholly from selfish considerations his parents were dead and two sisters were dependant on him for support one of these was nearly of his own age the other was scarcely emerged from childhood there was an intellectual as well as a personal resemblance between my friend and his sisters they possessed his physical infirmities his vehement passions and refinements of taste and the misery of his condition was tenfold increased by reflecting on the feelings which would be awakened in them by the knowledge of his state and the hardships to which the loss of his succor would expose them chapter xxviii it was not in my power to release my friend by the payment of his debt but board i could save him from famine and by suitable exertions could procure him lodging as convenient as the time would admit i could promise to console and protect his sisters and by cheerful tones and frequent visits dispel some part of the evil which encompassed him after the first surprise had subsided he inquired by what accident this meeting had been produced conscious of my incapacity to do him any essential service and unwilling to make me a partaker in his miseries he had forborne to inform me of his condition this assurance was listened to with some wonder i showed him the billet it had not been written by him he was a stranger to the penmanship none but the attorney and officer were apprized of his fate it was obvious to conclude that this was the interposition of some friend who knowing my affection for carlton had taken this mysterious method of calling me to his succor conjectures as to the author and considerations i requested an interview with the keeper and inquired how carlton could be best accommodated he said that all his rooms were full but one which in consequence of the dismission of three persons in the morning had at present but one tenant this person had lately arrived was sick and had with him at this time one of his friends carlton might divide the chamber with this person no doubt his consent would be readily given though this arrangement being the best must take place whether he consented or not this consent i resolved immediately to seek and for that purpose desired to be led to the chamber the door of the apartment was shut i knocked for admission it was instantly opened and i entered the first person who met my view was arthur mervyn i started with astonishment mervyn s countenance betrayed nothing but satisfaction at the interview the traces of fatigue and anxiety gave place to mervyn was the writer of the note which i had lately received to meet him within these walls and at this time was the most remote and undesirable of all contingencies the same hour had thus made me acquainted with the kindred and unwelcome fate of two beings whom i most loved i had scarcely time to return his embrace when taking my hand he led me to a bed that stood in one corner there was stretched upon it one whom a second glance enabled me to call by his name though i had never before seen him the vivid portrait which mervyn had drawn was conspicuous in the sunken and haggard visage before me this face had indeed proportions and lines which could never be forgotten or mistaken welbeck when once seen or described was easily distinguished from the rest of mankind he had stronger motives than other men for abstaining from guilt the difficulty of concealment or disguise being tenfold greater in him than in others by reason upon him he was pallid and emaciated he did not open his eyes on my entrance he seemed to be asleep but before i had time to exchange glances with mervyn or to inquire into the nature of the scene he awoke on seeing me he started and cast a look of upbraiding on my companion the latter comprehended his emotion and endeavored to appease him this person said he is my friend he is likewise a physician and perceiving your state to require medical assistance i ventured to send for him welbeck replied in a contemptuous and indignant tone thou mistakest my condition boy my disease lies deeper than his scrutiny will ever reach i had hoped thou wert gone thy importunities are well meant but they aggravate my miseries he now rose from the bed and continued in a firm and resolute tone you are intruders into this apartment it is mine and i desire to be left alone address he was immersed in perplexity at length raising his eyes from the floor he said my intentions are indeed honest and i am grieved that i want the power of persuasion tomorrow perhaps i may reason more cogently with your despair or your present mood may be changed to aid my own weakness i will entreat the assistance of this friend these words roused a new spirit in welbeck his confusion and anger increased his tongue faltered as he exclaimed good god what mean you headlong and rash as you are you will not share with this person your knowledge of me here he checked himself conscious that the words he had already uttered tended to the very end which he dreaded this consciousness added to the terror of more ample disclosures which the simplicity and rectitude of mervyn might prompt him to make chained up his tongue and covered him with dismay mervyn was not long in answering i comprehend your you the truth to this person your story has already been told whatever i have witnessed under your roof whatever i
most of those not connected with my father and his nephew i have often related at present therefore i shall omit all collateral and contemporary incidents and confine myself entirely to those connected with these two persons my father on the death of his wife retired from business and took a house in an airy and secluded situation his household consisted of a housekeeper and two or three servants and apartments were always open for his son my brother s temper grew more unmanageable as he increased in years my father s and discretion commonly dictate he wished him to acquire all possible advantages of education and then to betake himself to some liberal profession in which he might obtain honor as well as riches this sober scheme by no means suited the restless temper of the youth it was his maxim that all restraints were unworthy of a lad of spirit and that it was far more wise to spend freely what his father had painfully acquired than by the same plodding and toilsome arts to add to the heap i scarcely know how to describe my feelings in relation to this young man my affection for him was certainly without that tenderness which a good brother is sure to excite i do not remember a single direct kindness that i ever received from him but i remember innumerable ill offices and contempts still there was some inexplicable charm in the mere tie of kindred which made me more deplore his errors exult in his talents rejoice in his success and take a deeper interest as he advanced in age i had new cause for my zeal in his behalf my father s temper was easy and flexible my brother was at once vehement and artful frank s arguments and upbraidings created in his father an unnatural awe an apprehension and diffidence in thwarting his wishes and giving advice which usually distinguish the filial character the youth perceived his advantages and employed them in carrying every point on which his inclination was set for a long time this absurd indulgence was shewn in allowing his son to employ his time as he pleased in refraining from all animadversions on his idleness and dissipation and supplying him with a generous allowance of pocket money this allowance required now and then to be increased every year and every month by adding new sources of expense added something to the stipend my father s revenue was adequate to a very splendid establishment but he was accustomed to live frugally and thought it wise to add his savings to the principal less till at length my brother s numerous excursions a french girl whom he maintained in expensive lodgings his horses dogs and friends consumed the whole of it i never met my brother but by accident these interviews were for the most part momentary either in the street or at my father s house but i was too much interested in all that befel him not to make myself by various means thoroughly acquainted with his situation i had no power to remedy the evil as my elder brother and as a man he thought himself entitled to govern and despise me he always treated me as a frivolous girl with whom it was waste of time to converse and never spoke to me at all except to direct or admonish hence i could do nothing but regret his habits their consequences to himself it was beyond my power to prevent for a long time i was totally unaware of the tendencies of this mode of life would carry him beyond the bound of vulgar prudence or induce him to encroach on those funds from which his present enjoyments were derived i knew him to be endowed with an acute understanding and imagined that this would point out with sufficient clearness the wisdom of limiting his expenses to his income in my daily conversations with my father i never voluntarily introduced frank as our topic unless by the harmless and trite questions of when was he here where has he gone and the like we met only by accident at his lodgings when i entered the room where he was he never thought of bestowing more than a transient look on me just to know who it was that approached circumstances at length however occurred which put an end to this state of neutrality i heard twice or thrice a year from my cousin risberg one day a letter arrived in which he obscurely intimated that the failure of year had reduced him to great distress my father had always taught him to regard himself as entitled to all the privileges of a son had sent him to europe under express conditions of supplying him with a reasonable stipend till he should come of age at which period it was concerted that risberg should return and receive a portion with me enabling him to enter advantageously on the profession of the law to which he was now training this stipend was far from being extravagant or more than sufficient for the decent maintenance of a student at the temple and risberg s conduct had always been represented by those under whose eye he had been placed as regular and exemplary this intimation surprised me a good deal i could easily imagine the embarrassments to which a failure of this kind must subject a generous spirit and thought it my duty to remove them as soon as possible i supposed that some miscarriage or delay had happened to the money and that my father i hastened therefore to his house with the opened letter i found him alone and immediately showed him that page of the letter which related to this affair i anxiously watched his looks while he read it i observed marks of great surprise in his countenance and as soon as he laid down the letter i began to expatiate
conducted on the justest principles at the end of four years our protector found it expedient to make a voyage to cayenne his brother was an extensive proprietor in that colony but his sudden death made way for the succession of our friend to establish his claims his presence was necessary on the spot he was little qualified for arduous enterprises and his age demanded repose but his own acquisitions having been small and being desirous of leaving us in possession of competence he cheerfully embarked meanwhile my brother was placed at a celebrated seminary in the pais de vaud and i was sent to a sister who resided at verona i was at this time fourteen years old one year younger than my brother whom since that period i have neither heard of nor seen i was for myself the character of my new friend was austere and devout and there were so many incongenial points between us that but little tranquillity was enjoyed under her control the priest who discharged the office of her confessor thought proper to entertain views with regard to me grossly inconsistent with the sanctity of his profession he was a man of profound dissimulation and masterly address his efforts however were repelled with disdain my security against his attempts lay in the uncouthness and deformity which nature had bestowed upon his person and visage rather than in the firmness of my own principles the courtship of father bartoli the austerities of madame roselli the disgustful or insipid occupations to which i was condemned made me impatiently wish for a change but my father so i will call him had decreed that i should remain under his sister s guardianship till his return from guiana when this would happen was uncertain events unforeseer might protract it for years but it could incessantly preyed upon by discontent my solitude was loathsome i panted after liberty and friendship and the want of these were not recompensed by luxury and quiet and by the instructions in useful science which i received from bartoli who though detested as a hypocrite and lover was venerable as a scholar he would fain have been an abelard but it was not his fate to meet with an heloise two years passed away in this durance my miseries were exquisite i am almost at a loss to account for the unhappiness of that time for looking back upon it i perceive that an equal period could not have been spent with more benefit for the sake of being near me bartoli importunately offered his instructions he had nothing to communicate but metaphysics and geometry these were little to my taste but i could not keep him at distance i had no other alternative than to endure him as a lover or a teacher his passion for science was and both these passions combined to make him a sedulous instructer he was a disciple of the newest doctrines respecting matter and mind he denied the impenetrability of the first and the immateriality of the second these he endeavored to inculcate upon me as well as to subvert my religious tenets because he delighted like all men in transfusing his opinions and because he regarded my piety as the only obstacle to his designs he succeeded in dissolving the spell of ignorance but not in producing that kind of acquiescence he wished he had in this respect to struggle not only with my principles but my weakness he might have overcome every obstacle but my abhorrence of deformity and age to cure me of this aversion was beyond his power my servitude grew daily more painful i grew tired of chasing a comet to its aphelion and of untying the knot of an infinite series a change in my condition became indispensable to my very existence languor were at last my perpetual attendants madame roselli was alarmed at my condition the sources of my inquietude were incomprehensible to her the truth was that i scarcely understood them myself and my endeavors to explain them to my friend merely instilled into her an opinion that i was either lunatic or deceitful she complained and admonished but my disinclination to my usual employments would not be conquered and my health rapidly declined a physician who was called confessed that my case was beyond his power to understand but recommended as a sort of desperate expedient a change of scene a succession and variety of objects might possibly contribute to my cure at this time there arrived at verona lady d arcy an english woman of fortune and rank and a strenuous catholic her husband had lately died and in order to divert her grief as well as to gratify her curiosity in viewing the great seat of her religion she had come to italy this means she gained a knowledge of my person and condition and kindly offered to take me under her protection she meant to traverse every part of italy and was willing that i should accompany her in all her wanderings this offer was gratefully accepted in spite of the artifices and remonstrances of bartoli my companion speedily contracted for me the affection of a mother she was without kindred of her own religion having acquired her faith not by inheritance but conversion she desired to abjure her native country and to bind herself by every social tie to a people who adhered to the same faith me she promised to adopt as her daughter provided her first impressions in my favor were not belied by my future deportment my principles were opposite to her s but habit an aversion to displease my friend my passion for knowledge which my new condition enabled me to gratify all combined to make me a deceiver but my imposture was merely forbearance to contradict and by acting as she acted than by open assent and zealous concurrence my new state was on this account not devoid
the productions of europe and the prejudices which infect us are derived chiefly from this source these prejudices may be somewhat rectified by age and by converse with the world but they flourish in full vigor in youthful minds reared in seclusion and privacy and undisciplined by intercourse with various classes of mankind in me they possessed an unusual according to foreign usages and my notions of dignity were modelled on a scale which the revolution has completely taken away i could never forget that my condition was that of a peasant and in spite of reflection i was the slave of those sentiments of self contempt and humiliation which pertain to that condition elsewhere through chimerical and visionary on the western side of the atlantic my ambition of dignity and fortune grew out of this supposed inferiority of rank experience had taught me how slender are the genuine wants of a human being and made me estimate at their true value the blessings of competence and fixed property our fears are always proportioned to our hopes and what is ardently desired appears when placed within our reach to be an illusion designed to torment us we are inclined to question the reality of that which our foresight had never suggested as near though our wishes had perpetually hovered around it when the death of wilmot put his when converted into land would procure her and the man whom her affection had distinguished a domain of four or five hundred fertile acres my emotions i can not describe many would be less affected in passing from a fisherman s hovel to the throne of an opulent nation it so much surpassed the ordinary bounds of my foresight and even of my wishes that for a time i was fain to think myself in one of my usual walking dreams my doubts were dispelled only by the repetition of the same impressions and by the lapse of time i gradually became familiarized to the change and by frequently revolving its benefits and consequences raised the tenor of my ordinary sensations to the level as it were of my new condition from this unwonted height morton s reappearance had thrown us down to our original obscurity but now my old preceptor had started up before me and like my good genius had brought with him gifts immeasurable and hemisphere they occupied an elevation in the social scale to which i could scarcely raise my eyes yet they were now within a short journey of my dwelling i was going to be ushered into their presence but my privilege was not to be circumscribed by any sober limits this heiress of opulence and splendor this child of fortune and appropriator of elegance and grace and beauty was proffered to me as a wife i reflected on the education which i had received from mr howard his affection for me which had been unlimited his relation to his wife s daughter and the authority and respect which that relation as well as his personal qualities produced i reflected on the futility of titular distinction on the capriciousness of wealth and its independence of all real merit in the possessor but still i could not retain but for a moment the confidence and self respect which flowed from these thoughts i was still nothing more than an obscure and cornfield and to whose level it was impossible for a being qualified and educated like clara ever to descend you must not imagine however that this descent was desired by me i was bound by every tie of honor though not of affection to mary wilmot incited by compassion and by gratitude i had plighted my vows to her and had formed no wish or expectation of revoking them these vows were to be completed in a few months by marriage but this event by the unfortunate though seasonable and equitable claim of morton was placed at an uncertain distance marriage while both of us were poor would be an act of the utmost indiscretion what however was taken away by morton might i fondly conceived be restored to us by the generosity of mr howard it was not indeed perfectly agreeable to the dictates of my pride to receive fortune as the boon of any one howard more as my father than teacher and it seemed as if i had a natural right to every gift which was needful to my happiness and which was in his power to bestow mary and her claims on me were indeed unknown to my friend he had no reason to be particularly interested in her fate and her claims interfered with those schemes which he had apparently formed with relation to clara and myself how i asked might he regard her claims in what light would he consider that engagement of the understanding rather than of the heart into which i had entered how far would he esteem it proper to adhere to it and what efforts might he make to dissolve it various incidents had hindered me from thoroughly explaining to him my situation during his short stay at hatfield but i resolved to seize the opportunity of our next meeting and by a frank disclosure to put an end to all my doubts meanwhile an account of all these events to mary and impatiently waited the arrival of a letter the period of my friend s absence was nearly expired and the hourly expectation of his return prevented me from visiting mary in person instead of his coming however i at length received a letter from him in these terms richmond nov i shall not call on you at hatfield i am weary of traversing hills and dales and my detention in virginia being longer than i expected shall go on board a vessel in this port bound for new york contract in my name with your old friend for the present accommodation of the girls
me i must make immediate preparation to embark as the ship in which he had engaged a passage would be ready to depart in three days this expedition was unexpected there was an impatience in his manner when he urged the necessity of despatch that excited my surprise when i questioned him as to the cause of this haste he generally stated reasons which at that time i could not deny to be plausible but which on the review appeared insufficient i suspected that the true motives were concealed and believed that these motives had some connexion with my brother s destiny i now recollected that time been imparted to me was always accompanied with airs of reserve and mysteriousness what had appeared sufficiently explicit at the time it was uttered i now remembered to have been faltering and ambiguous i was resolved to remove my doubts by visiting the unfortunate man in his dungeon heretofore the idea of this visit had occurred to me but the horrors of his dwelling place his wild yet placid physiognomy his neglected locks the fetters which constrained his limbs terrible as they were in description how could i endure to behold now however that i was preparing to take an everlasting farewell of my country now that an ocean was henceforth to separate me from him how could i part without an interview i would examine his situation with my own eyes i would know whether the representations which had been made to me were true perhaps the sight of the sister whom he was wont to love with a passion more than fraternal might have an auspicious i waited to communicate it to mr cambridge i was aware that without his concurrence i could not hope to carry it into execution and could discover no objection to which it was liable if i had not been deceived as to his condition no inconvenience could arise from this proceeding his consent therefore would be the test of his sincerity i seized this opportunity to state my wishes on this head my suspicions were confirmed by the manner in which my request affected him after some pause in which his countenance betrayed every mark of perplexity he said to me why would you pay this visit what useful purpose can it serve we are preparing said i to leave the country forever what kind of being should i be to leave behind me a brother in calamity without even a parting interview indulge me for three minutes in the sight of him my heart will be much easier after i have looked at i believe otherwise the sight of him would only augment your distress without contributing in any degree to his benefit i know not that returned i surely the sympathy of his sister proofs that her tenderness is as lively as ever must be a source of satisfaction to him at present he must regard all mankind as his enemies and calumniators his sister he probably conceives to partake in the general infatuation and to join in the cry of abhorrence that is raised against him to be undeceived in this respect to be assured that however i may impute his conduct to delusion i still retain all my former affection for his person and veneration for the purity of his motives can not but afford him pleasure when he hears that i have left the country without even the ceremonious attention of a visit what will he think of me his magnanimity may hinder him from repining but he will surely dear sir i must pay this visit to embark with you without paying it will be impossible it may be of no service to him but will enable me to acquit myself of what i can not but esteem a duty besides continued i if it be a mere fit of insanity that has seized him may not my presence chance to have a salutary influence the mere sight of me it is not impossible may rectify his perceptions ay said my uncle with some eagerness it is by no means impossible that your interview may have that effect and for that reason beyond all others would i dissuade you from it i expressed my surprise at this declaration is it not to be desired that an error so fatal as this should be rectified i wonder at your question reflect on the consequences of this error has he not destroyed the wife whom he loved enables him to bear the remembrance but the belief that he acted as his duty enjoined would you rashly bereave him of this belief would you restore him to himself and convince him that he was instigated to this dreadful outrage by a perversion of his organs or a delusion from hell now his visions are joyous and elate he conceives himself to have reached a loftier degree of virtue than any other human being the merit of his sacrifice is only enhanced in the eyes of superior beings by the detestation that pursues him here and the sufferings to which he is condemned the belief that even his sister has deserted him and gone over to his enemies adds to his sublimity of feelings and his confidence in divine approbation and future recompense let him be undeceived in this respect and what floods of despair and of horror will overwhelm him instead of glowing approbation and serene hope will he not hate and torture himself self violence or a be expected to succeed i beseech you therefore to relinquish this scheme if you calmly reflect upon it you will discover that your duty lies in carefully shunning him mr cambridge s reasonings suggested views to my understanding that had not hitherto occurred i could not but admit their validity but they showed in a new light the depth of that misfortune in which my brother was plunged i was silent and irresolute presently
lonely priest finding his heart daily warming toward him induced the squaw who nursed him to take up her abode in his own wigwam the indians called him otoolpha the son of the stranger and seemed to regard the adopted one with quite as much interest as their own offspring not a year after otoolpha and his nurse were domesticated in the dwelling of the jesuit some of the tribe on their return from canada found a nearly famished female infant in the wood had not sebastian rall been of the party its sufferings would probably have met a violent end but at his suggestion comfortable nourishment and such care as they could give it were afforded a nose slightly approaching to aquiline and a complexion less darkly colored than usual betrayed an origin half european but as her parentage and tribe were unknown they gave her the emphatic engrafted her on the tree of abnakis from the first dawn of reason she gave indications of an impetuous fearless and romantic spirit the squaw who nursed her together with the little otoolpha tried in vain to curb her roving propensities at four and five years old she would frequently be absent several days accompanied by her foster brother the duties of the missionary often called him far from home and it was absolutely impossible for him always to watch over them either in kindness or authority their long excursions during his absence at first occasioned many anxious and wretched thoughts but when he found his wayward protgs invariably returned and when he saw they could cross streams leap ditches and thread their way through the labyrinths of the wilderness with the boldness and sagacity of young hunters he ceased to disturb himself on their account during the whole of their adventurous childhood but one accident ever happened to them they had been at the english settlement to and on their return they took a fancy to cross the kennebec when recent rains had swollen its deep and beautiful waters saupoolah s life nearly fell a sacrifice to the rapidity of the current but her foster brother ran with the speed of lightning to call assistance from the village they had just left a muscular kind hearted woman by the name of allan lived in a log house very near the river in the midst of his terror otoolpha remembered this circumstance and went there for succor his frightened looks told his story even more plainly than his hurried exclamation ogh saupoolah die the great spirit drink her up mrs allan saved the indian child at the risk of her own life dried her clothes gave them something warm and comfortable to eat and conducted them into their homeward path in safety to this woman and her children otoolpha and saupoolah ever after clung with singular intensity of affection during their childish with berries for her little ones whom they always chose to feed with their own hands watching every morsel of the fruit as it disappeared between their rosy lips with the most animated expressions of delight and when they arrived at maturer years they used the great influence they had with the tribe to protect mrs allan from a thousand petty wrongs and insults with which her white brethren were not unfrequently visited educated by the learned priest as far as such fetterless souls could be educated and associating only with savages these extraordinary young people grew up with a strange mixture of european and aboriginal character both had the rapid elastic tread of indians but the outlines of their tall erect figures possessed something of the pliant gracefulness of france when indignant the expression of their eyes was like light from a burning glass but in softer moments they had a melting glance which belongs only to a civilized and voluptuous land saupoolah s hair though remarkably soft and otoolpha s was brown and when moistened by exercise it sometimes curled slightly around his high prominent forehead the same mixture of nations was shown in their costume as in their personal appearance otoolpha usually wore a brown cloth tunic with tight sleeves and large buttons under which appeared a scarlet kilt falling to his knees in heavy folds edged with the fur of the silver fox and fastened at the waist by a broad girdle richly ornamented with indian hieroglyphics a coronet of scarlet dyed fur to which were fastened four silver bells gave indication of his noble descent and from his neck were suspended a cross and rosary of sandal wood which sebastian rall declared to have been sanctified by the blessed touch of innocent the eleventh saupoolah s dress was nearly similar her tunic was deep yellow and her scarlet kilt touched the fur edge of her high closely fitted and very gaudy moccasins her cap was not shaped unlike a bishop s surmounted by the black feathers of three eagles her own arrow had slain in the chase she was as eager and keen eyed as otoolpha it was a noble sight to see them equipped for the chase bounding along through the forest the healthful and rapid blood coursing beneath their smooth brown cheeks gave a richness and vividness of beauty which a fair transparent complexion can never boast and their motions had that graceful elasticity produced only by activity unconsciousness and freedom sebastian rall had been several years at rome in the service of the pope and had there acquired a refinement of taste uncommon at that early period his adopted children sometimes accompanied him on his missionary expeditions to canada and elsewhere on which occasions the game they killed served for his support when he saw them with their dark eyes fixed on a distant bird arrows ready for flight their majestic figures slightly bending backward resting on one knee with an advancing foot firmly fixed of the limb outlines most gracefully curved he gazed upon them with uncontrolled delight and he

the evening of the day in which the events just related took place a miss blakeney a very amiable girl under the protection of the rev mr matthews who with his wife and her sister the honourable mrs cavendish and two young ladies to whom he is they are a charming family i wish my father s health would permit my bringing you acquainted with them it is impossible said his mother sighing for besides that the health of your dear father is in a very precarious state i fear that he has something heavy at his heart he is much altered jack within the last few months his rest is disturbed and indeed it is only by powerful opiates that he obtains any and by them alone the smallest exhiliration of spirits his wound is no doubt very painful my dear madam replied the son but we will hope that change of scene and strict attention to the advice of the medical gentlemen who attend him will in time restore him at that moment the colonel s bell summoned his servant and the mother of franklin flew to the apartment of her husband to strive to alleviate his sufferings by her tenderness and cheer him by her said the colonel when that faintness seized me at the library near the stiene my dear do you not recollect the interesting girl who presented her smelling bottle the colonel put his hand to his head spoke a few words in an under voice and leaning back on a sofa on which he was seated closed his eyes and his wife continuing silent he dropped into a perturbed slumber we will return to london said he on awaking we will set off to morrow and then make an excursion to margate and ramsgate from thence to bellevue where we will finish the summer why not go to your sister s for a few weeks she will be much disappointed if we do not make her a visit this season what to hampshire no no i can not go to hampshire the next morning mr franklin having breakfasted with and taken leave of his parents they three days in the vain hope that another place would contribute to restore the health and spirits of the colonel as the delicacy of every member of mr matthew s family forbade the smallest recurrence to the rencontre in the library with the invalid officer who they had learnt was the father of lieutenant franklin when two days after he mentioned the departure of his parents from brighton no remark was made but the kind wish offered that his health might soon be restored the officers upon duty at brighton having received many civilities from numerous families of distinction temporary residents there determined as it drew near the close of the season to give a splendid ball mr matthews family were among the invited guests lady mary was wild with delight even lucy felt somewhat exhilirated at the idea of a ball where all the splendor and fashion of the place would assemble and where it was expected some personages of exalted rank would make their appearance aura melville was the most stoical heart did palpitate a little quicker than usual when edward ainslie requested to be her partner the two first dances perhaps those quickened pulsations will in some measure account for the perfect indifference with which she had listened to all her admirers balls in anticipation and indeed in reality are very pleasant to those engaged in them but most insufferably dull in detail it will therefore be sufficient to say that our three orphans enjoyed themselves extremely well the attentions of franklin to lucy were very pointed so much so that mr matthews was resolved should they continue and the lieutenant follow them into hampshire to call upon him for an explanation of his intentions and candidly state to him miss blakeney s real situation in order that should an union take place such settlements might be made as should secure to her independence for life whatever events might hereafter happen the morning after the ball lady mary held forth for a full hour upon the splendid appearance gallant manners and evident flirted and flattered till he had stirred up a strange commotion in her little vain heart lucy heard her and smiled aura smiled too but it was with a look of arch meaning while she replied to the often repeated question of do you not own he is very handsome why yes as far as tolerable features good eyes and teeth with more than tolerable dress goes i think he is passable but my dear lady mary he has no noble blood in his veins his grandfather was only lord mayor of london and you know you told me your mother would not rest in her grave if you matched with aught below nobility now sir stephen haynes s father and his father before him were only stationers and booksellers and who knows my pretty mary lady mary i beg your pardon who knows but this very sir stephen haynes may on the female side be a collateral descendant of the renowned helena with his cat how do you know it was to st helena aura said mr matthews looking up for he had been reading in the parlour where the young folks were talking over the events of the preceding evening oh i only surmised sir because i read in some geographical work that the island of st helena was infested with rats so that the inhabitants could neither raise or preserve grain of any kind upon it in which case a cat must have been a very valuable animal lady mary would have left the parlour in a pet but that she hoped the baronet would call in the course of the morning he did so and exercised the art of flattery so successfully that mary lumley totally forgot the
years younger than her husband and still that constancy that devotedness of affection that charity with which she seems to be always waiting to promote her husband s comfort the improvement of her children and the happiness of all around her in the centre of the room stands an old fashioned round table covered with books newspapers a board exhibiting the royal game of fox and geese and all the feminine apparatus of needle work on the side of the table if side can be predicated of a round form next his mother is the place of master robert gage the eldest hope a scholar fitting for college already ambitious of being a great man near to him usually stand or sit his two brothers frolicksome fellows whose glee over their game or their books frequently awakens their mother s reproofs the rogues however pay little attention to her soft spoken remonstrances but if they meet their father s eye frowning disprovingly or hear they are hushed as sleep opposite master robert sits the only daughter of my host the sweet catharine positively edward the loveliest girl i ever beheld there she sits looking so meek and innocent as she bends her head closer to her work whenever i too earnestly regard her but sometimes usually when i enter the room she looks up in my face with such a smile o when i can flatter myself as i try to do that it welcomes me to the family circle you can not know how happy i feel i am prevented from taking a seat beside her because that is always occupied by her brother john the youngest child but one he loves catharine so well that i can not help loving the little urchin on her account or otherwise i fear i should really hate him for there he will sit a full hour after i am at home and he will engross all the attention catharine can helps her wind her thread and he holds her work basket and picks up her scissors or handkerchief and often claims a kiss for his reward i have really wanted to strike that boy there are always two vacant chairs left for mr silsby and your humble servant and as i have my first choice i take the one nearest to catharine but that is of little consequence while john remains colonel gage converses with the ease of one accustomed to society and he has moreover all the fund of anecdote which a revolutionary soldier and a pioneer in our new settlements might be expected to possess i have learned more from him of the early history of my country more of the peculiar spirit of the early settlers of their character their labors and resources than i ever learned before in my whole life at nine o clock or a little before mr silsby makes his appearance and then the four younger boys are dismissed to bed manner in which their father takes leave of them for the night has a solemnity that awes and prevents me from taking any advantage of my proximity to address catharine the boys in leaving the room pass directly by their father they pause before him while he in a tone of tender and touching pathos dispenses a few sentences of reproof advice or commendation to each individual i never witnessed such a scene i should think it would have a powerful effect on their tender hearts for when as he receives their bow or kiss he adds god bless you my children i often find it difficult to breathe freely after a short pause however we begin to converse and all join in the discourse more cheerfully if possible than before news politics literature and anecdote with an occasional tune on the piano forte the colonel is quite an enthusiast in his love of music and the hour of ten that we always have apples and cider and frequently nuts of some kind during the evening and furthermore i confess that during the last hour as the fire is gradually suffered to decay we as gradually draw nearer to the hearth and our circle contracting i am at last usually quite near catharine i say usually because whenever catharine leaves her chair to play a tune she seldom returns to it she contrives to steal round to her father s side and seats herself on a low chair close by his knee a seat claimed by the little boy when he is there i wish from my soul he would take that small chair with him when he goes to bed i expect you will smile at what i am now going to confess you will wish you were here to quiz me so do not i though conscious i am acting rightly i have hardly sufficient courage yet to stand the test of ridicule but as one conquest over family devotions from choice that i kneel at prayers that colonel gage is a methodist and that catharine says amen in a tone so soft sweet and angelic that it causes me to feel my own unworthiness more poignantly than would the severest reproofs i never before comprehended what the distress of macbeth was when he could not say amen yes edward when i can kneel beside that innocent girl and catch her soft whispered amen as her saint like father pauses in the aspirations he has been pouring forth perhaps for my salvation i fancy she always responds the sweetest then though in the lowest tone my heart throbs and swells till i believe tears have relieved me from the agitation of my feelings but this agitation is not care or pain or discontent no i lay my head on my pillow in peace everything around me is peaceful my reflections are all tinged with the o evenings worthy of the gods you may exclaim while revelling in your round of amusements
he said and died butler on perceiving from his station on the balcony this interruption to the execution of his victims hastened forward to ascertain distinctly the cause by the time he approached the hermit had ceased to speak he saw brandt powerfully affected he was surprised for he knew not the cause what is this the hero of the mohawks said he upbraiding his confederate in iniquity i thought thou hadst the soul of a warrior but thy heart is grown feeble like a woman s the spirits of thy fathers will be ashamed of thy weakness brandt cast upon him a look of indignation the spirits of my fathers ashamed of me he exclaimed ay they will curse me but thou thou hast nothing to do with my fathers hie hence lest if thou frettest what art thou indeed mad cried butler in astonishment does it grieve thee that thou hast slain a peevish grey beard who was thy enemy ha cried brandt seizing his tomahawk which was still reeking with the blood of his father if thou wilt scoff again i have a weapon accustomed to pierce hearts by the blood that is now upon it i swear i am thy friend no longer nonsense returned butler perceiving the impolicy of irritating the savage farther i wish not to offend thee i can not comprehend the cause of thy agitation but enough of it let us now proceed with the sacrifice of the prisoners ah exclaimed the savage his habitual taste for destruction returning our customs require it he was but a white man he said to the executioners who now stood near him and could not be and let the sacrifice be offered being no longer in awe of rodolph whom they now considered a deceiver and who lay dead before them the executioners hastened to re kindle their brands which they soon accomplished and waving them as they blazed and crackled in the air they proceeded towards the piles but before they could apply the flaming instruments to their destructive purpose a sudden shout of warlike voices issued from the woods and a number of musket balls pierced each of them together with the ferocious brandt and stretched them on the ground this was instantaneously followed by a more abundant visitation of the same deadly missiles upon the thickest groups of the indians more than a hundred of whom fell and the rest fled in terror from the scene butler with the whole force of the tories was now advancing to check the flight of the indians and give battle to the assailants when henry austin at the head of the wyoming volunteers the wood and charged the traitorous destroyers with the bayonet they made but a short resistance they were unable to withstand even the first shock of their disciplined adversaries they broke and imitating their indian allies fled into the depths of the forest leaving two hundred of their party dead on the field butler even in this extremity resolved to make an effort to retain possession of agnes he hurried from the scene of battle as soon as he saw that the day was lost to the balcony where he had left her in charge of a sentinel by this time however the prisoners were unbound and dr watson whose anxious eye followed the career of butler over the field perceived this movement the intention of which he at once conjectured just as henry austin approached towards him fly henry said he fly to yonder balcony and save your betrothed from the destroyer with the speed of an arrow henry obeyed her off he with one spring mounted the balcony and one powerful thrust of his sword annihilated the opposition which the sentinel imprudently offered to his advance upon butler ah infamous miscreant cried he to the latter thank heaven i have thee i know that this is my death scene said the courageous ruffian for thy soldiers surround me but i shall die with the satisfaction of knowing that thou my detested rival shalt not survive to enjoy agnes so saying he made a desperate pass at henry aiming not to save himself but to destroy his antagonist that antagonist however was too expert a swords man to be endangered by such maniac rashness he struck the coming weapon aside with such force that it almost flew from its owner s grasp while his own sword in its backward sweep nearly dissevered butler s head from his body by that heaven directed blow said colonel dennison hast avenged the desolation of a whole people thou hast also said dr watson who entered immediately after the colonel avenged thy father and thy sister and rescued thy betrothed from unspeakable misery from the hands of a villain oh agnes exclaimed henry straining her to his palpitating breast my beloved my faithful one thou art yet my own i am happy heaven hath preserved thee for me i see thee again said she oh henry thanks to the eternal this is indeed happiness the tears rushed to her eyes she hid her burning blushes in his bosom and sobbed aloud the grateful agitations of her heart bless thee my son said mr norwood who now with miss watson advanced towards the victor the hand of heaven is manifest in this day s deliverance may the almighty power that sent thee at the critical moment thee and that maiden thy own betrothed who has been true to thee and to her vows amidst the severest trials that could beset human nature but we haste to close our narrative and must therefore decline entering into a detail of the congratulations and outpourings of gratitude of which henry austin was now the object the party retired from the eventful balcony to the residence of mr norwood which was so lately the prison of its venerable master and his friends henry now informed them that it was owing
it was my wedding ring take it to my wife and what shall i say to her nothing nothing what have you nothing to say no message to send to her not a word poor mary the ring will be message enough to satisfy her she will understand it farewell no no what more can i do for you where shall i find you to morrow to morrow with a bitter smile god only knows but i pray you to leave me now and go straightway to mary with that ring do that my dear sir i was deeply affected by his manner do that and you will have done for me all that it is now possible for man to do edwards what do you mean i mean what i say there is no hope for me no hope finish what i had to say turning toward the messenger who had several banknotes in his hand which he had picked up without being observed and which had been carried away by the draft from the open door while we were engaged in the fearful inquiry that his appearance had provoked now sir i am ready for you good night all good night good night good night said every body in the room and almost every body with a voice of deep seated emotion they were scattered about some sitting some standing as if a thunderbolt had fallen through the roof he passed out and i was going to follow when i was stopped by two strangers while the man that i saw at the cottage fontleroy stepped forward with a cheerful air and begged to know if bail would be received bail no said a gruff voice and we parted he for a lock up house i thought and i to deliver a to see chapter xxii the ring the watchman the moment i was in the street i began to look about for a coach determined whatever might be the hour to lose no time in the delivery of the charge entrusted to me for how could i be sure of the morrow how could i know what story the ring would tell to the deserted wife what was to be done should or should i not see her should i go to her at once or wait till the morrow there would be no sleep for her while the husband of her heart was away no sleep for me till i had done what i had undertaken to do but there was no coach to be had the great squares and wide streets before me were all deserted i drew out my watch with surprise i had no idea of the hour it was after three o clock the lamps were going out and i saw on looking up the day light spreading over a clear blue sky and felt as i stood there debating with myself how to proceed what i have not felt since the cool air blowing upon my forehead as if i were at sea there was no time to be lost and after a little hesitation i hurried away agitated with a fear that grew more and more insupportable at every step and giddy with a feeling that i dare not speak of now before i had determined what course to pursue i found myself at the door of no street bedford square i stopped i stood still my courage died away and i strove to reason myself out of the dreadful vague fear that possessed me but i could not and i was actually turning away from the door with a determination which a few minutes before nothing would have induced me to make when i saw a light which appeared to proceed from the back parlor on the ground floor it be sure to see from the place where a fond faithful wife is watching over a baby or waiting for its father i knocked and immediately the light moved and a voice reached my ear with an accent of joy and a step came hurrying to the door but just when it was so near that i felt it necessary to draw back i heard another step and a heavier one approach and after a word or two in a sweet kind voice that nobody could hear without emotion the light eager step withdrew and the door was opened a little way a very little way just far enough for me to see the head of a man stooping with age who started back when he saw me saying who are you what do you want here i should like to know where is master ned who is it philip cried some one at the top of the staircase where i saw the shadow of a woman projected to her bosom and her whole attitude that of one who listens with breathless anxiety i do nt know i m sure it s a stranger said he grappling the heavy door chain with both hands looking at me as if he had just been waked out of a sound sleep and speaking as if he thought i intended to force my way a stranger is he alone i believe so peeping out as he spoke go to your mistress and say to her if she has not retired that i beg leave to see her said i i have a message for her open the door philip open the door i know that voice but the old man could not open the door the chain was heavy the catch had slipped and he shook so that i could not help asking where the other servants were he made no reply but i saw by his look that notwithstanding all i had been of powdered lackeys and rich livery there were no other servants in that large house now that the dinner was over and the company away none but this
more courteous reply there was now another pause and mrs leet seemed revolving in her mind how it might best be broken we shall be sorry to see you go forth from the shelter of our roof to night mr pardon me sir i have forgotten your name kellond at your service madam thomas kellond and my friend mr kirk ah thank you let me help you to a bit of this cold chicken mr kellond you must have found but poor accommodations on your route you dined at middletown i presume sir continued mrs leet we ate our last meal at hartford madam replied mr kellond and certainly had nothing to complain of for we colony could afford governor leet who had till this moment affected perfect indifference to the communications of the strangers now lifted his large blue eyes fixing them alternately upon each of his unknown guests with a gaze of deep and fluctuating curiosity a conversation which he had previously maintained with mr russel was however quickly resumed though from time to time an anxious glance at the strangers intimated a greater degree of interest in their communications than he chose to express the repast was at length completed and the table having been removed to a less conspicuous station the family again encircled the fire meanwhile every thing had been arranged according to the well established rules of the household a fresh supply of fuel crackled on the neatly swept hearth the stand the lights and the books were all in waiting on the other side of the fire place the children surrounded a low round table pursuing their respective avocations with an air of decorum which contrasted strongly with a demure countenance knitting a pair of woolen hose for her brother while the latter leaned with frowning brows upon his slate beside her flourishing his pencil with many a threatening manoeuvre over the mysterious problems beneath the youth did indeed occasionally pause amid his mathematical reveries to examine into the conduct of an intelligent kitten sporting beneath the table at that moment dextrously engaged with susan s ball and amusing her fancy with the graceful undulations of the long white thread as it darted across her way but no such trivial sport had power to arrest the attention of henry davenport as he bowed his young head over the classic page his hand supported his forehead straying among the dark and beautiful locks that shaded it and whenever the eye of the youthful scholar was for a moment lifted there was that in its deep lustre that told of a mind fitted to revel among the rich fountains of ancient lore gifted with the inspiration of exalted fancy and the history is woven with our tale sat in a low chair beside him in the first bloom of infant thoughts and feelings and with the tints of cradle dreams still bright in her young fancy her eyes seemed intent on the personages who now surrounded the fire their naturally pensive expression often vanishing amid smiles and dimples as she met their glances in return indeed there were others who now began to survey the scene with much interest governor leet after exchanging his boots for slippers had seated himself by the opposite stand the candles were snuffed the spectacles wiped and replaced and he now seemed waiting with the most comfortable composure for any commmunications that might be made the silence of curious expectation pervaded the whole apartment interrupted only by the slight and occasional ringing of the china cups as mrs leet carefully wiped and replaced them on the waiter considerable hesitation seemed to exist with the strangers as to which of them should first open their embassy but at of studied reserve broke silence governor leet the business with which we are intrusted is of an official and private nature it would be well that we had fewer witnesses no one here but my family i believe exclaimed the old gentleman his eye passing in rapid review over the circle unless indeed we except this young friend of ours and his eye rested on mr russel but we reckon him about as good as one of us he added with an expression of pleasantry which brought the blood in richer tides to miss weldon s cheek i beg your pardon sir but i believe we are all to be trusted nevertheless you must be aware sir replied mr kirk as he drew forth a large pocket book that there are certain undertakings which need to be executed with secrecy and despatch in order to insure them success perfectly the young gentleman after carefully examining the contents of the pocket book presented him with a folded paper the governor glanced anxiously over it and those who were watching his countenance perceived that it became instantly and strongly flushed his natural composure of aspect was however soon resumed and he began in a low whisper to examine its contents miss weldon was seated at the opposite side of the stand on which her uncle leaned and she became instantly aware that the kind of humming tone into which the whisper had gradually swelled was not the unconscious and unnecessary sound it seemed with the quickness of female penetration she at once perceived that there was something in the contents of the paper which her uncle desired her to understand the frill she was working dropped from her hand and leaning her head over the table she listened with breathless interest to the voice of the reader after a short suspension the low murinur again commenced but as yet she caught nothing but more distinct and the words treason and rebellion were plainly distinguished then was another pause and then distinctly followed and we do hereby authorize and appoint our true and loyal subjects governor leet exclaimed mr kirk hastily you must be aware that the revealing of state secrets may be attended with serious
the world and a soldier to be overcome by a non entity an ideal mockery he resolved not to harbour even the consciousness of having suspect that if the voice had not been altogether imaginary it might have proceeded from some person desirous of playing him a trick and who had consequently become acquainted with the timidity he had displayed and would no doubt expose it so as to render him an object of ridicule among his companions such a thought he could not endure he therefore again turned his steps towards the arbour and again from some inexplicable cause he became alarmed as he approached it he stole slowly and cautiously forward as if he were afraid to apprize the attendant spirit of the fatal spot of his presence he strained to the utmost his faculties of seeing and hearing in order that nothing whether earthly or unearthly should take him by surprise the wind was gentle but to his excited senses it moved audibly with fitful sighs among the trembling leaves of the pendent willows that surrounded him as he drew near to the arbour louder than was consistent with the mild condition of the wind at length the articulate sounds of ruin ruin struck upon his ear a sudden chillness crept over him he faltered in his pace but it was only for a moment he struggled with his weakness his courage returned and he determined not to yield again to the influence of terror be its cause either real or imaginary with a violent effort he advanced to the entrance of the arbour but he advanced no further for there now stood before his terrified vision a figure which sent a cold shuddering through all his veins and almost froze the current of his life at its fountain it was the figure of mary balantyne in her winding sheet shadowy thin pale pensive and awfully solemn in her looks she shook her head slowly and mournfully as she fixed a withering gaze upon him he would in the surprise of his first recognition of her appearance have sunk from the branch of a tree at which he caught while his enfeebled joints trembled beneath him harris however was neither cowardly nor superstitious and he had long indulged in absolute scepticism regarding the spirits of deceased human beings becoming visible on earth in a few seconds therefore he began to rally his fortitude and soon recovered sufficient firmness to look at the apparition and address it who art thou said he that assumest the likeness of one who is dead and can not consequently be now standing before me wretched man the figure replied and its voice thrilled fearfully like electric fire along the nerves of the awe struck criminal remember this fatal spot dark is thy doom we meet again the apparition then slowly faded away among the foliage at the back part of the arbour and became invisible like a thin mist disappearing from the side of a green hill or a light cloud by moonlight the terrified culprit was for some time scarcely sensible of the departure of the awful image his fixed gaze was riveted as if by enchantment on the spot where it had stood and its fearful words still tingled in his ears his perceptions at length gradually returned to their natural state and he became sensible of his true situation his strength of frame was restored and perhaps his hardihood but not his tranquillity of mind he hastened to his quarters but his conscience was now disturbed and he no longer reflected with pride or complacency on the triumph he had gained in the shades of dilworth over the innocence and virtue of the loveliest maiden they had ever screened from the glare of the noon tide sun but although frightened into remorse he was not humbled into penitence instead of seeking tranquillity in a fixed resolution to sin no more he sought oblivion for his troubles in the intoxicating revel and in the jovial carousals of his brother officers awful apparition in the arbour was soon for a time obliterated perhaps this power of affording temporary relief to the conscience struck mind is the most mischievous in its effects upon mankind that is possessed by inebrieting fluids thousands who would be driven by the goadings of remorse to seek geninue relief in amendment of life fly to the fallacious substitute which is offered in the hilarity of the bowl and instead of cherishing that salutary regret for past misconduct which would naturally lead to reformation as the only means of regaining tranquillity they seek a transient refuge from remorse in the turbulence of a fleeting madness which removes every good impression and confirms every evil propensity on the return of sobriety however harris felt his mind ill at ease every object in and around the place where he had fixed his quarters reminded him of his crime and of the awful vision which had denounced him for it he hastened to remove from the neighbourhood and for the purpose of diverting upon him he plunged with unwonted activity into the exciting scenes of the desultory warfare in which he was now engaged

you may thank your skill in this vulgar accomplishment i answered that you do not carry a black eye to the brakes as it is you have nothing to fear on that score and i promise you will say nothing that shall lead to your detection this is only of a piece with my other miseries said he it is another proof of the tyranny to which a man is exposed who is obliged to square his conduct to the caprices of a mistress i declare to you i feel at this moment like a schoolboy who is compelled to rack his wits for some plausible lie to escape a whipping truly ned you are a most ridiculous lover said i of all men i ever knew i certainly never saw one who took so little trouble to square his conduct to any rule this is the merest farce that ever was acted little does bel suspect that she has in her train such a trembling slave why sir it is the perpetual burthen of her complaint that your recklessness of her rises to the most flagrant contumacy and to tell you the truth i think she has reason on her laughing be that as it may say nothing about the feat of to day because in sober earnest i am not quite satisfied with the exploit myself i certainly was under no obligation to drub that rascal rutherford in the discussion of this topic we arrived at the brakes where both joy and surprise were manifested at finding fairbourne brought back in fetters to his prison harvey riggs clapped his hands and called out bravo well done hazard did nt i say bel that ned would perform as many wonders as the seven champions altogether is there such another true knight in the land as for bel she was raised into the loftiest transports she laughed asked a thousand questions darted from place to place and taking fairbourne in her hand smoothed his feathers and kissed him over and over again the rest of the family joined in similar expressions of pleasure and ned gave a circumstantial detail of all the facts the affair that followed it when this was done harvey again heaped a torrent of applause upon the knight of the hawk as he called hazard and with a lively sally sang out in a cracked and discordant voice oh t is love t is love t is love that rules us all completely oh t is love t is love t is love commands and we obey which he concluded with sundry antics and danced out of the room bel upon hearing the part that wilful acted in the recapture declared that she would take him into high favour and that thenceforth he should have the freedom of the parlour saying this she patted him upon the back and made him lie down at her feet hey day this is a fine rout and pother about a vagabond bird said mr tracy will you lose your senses good to gather toys for these women you have made bel your slave for life bel blushed scarlet red at this intimation and ned observing it followed suit their eyes met a precious pair of fools to make so much of so small a thing fairbourne was carried to his perch and regaled with a meal and the composure of the family being restored after the conclusion of this important affair we sat down to talk upon other matters swansdown we were told had taken his departure after breakfast mr tracy harvey assured us had been in his study nearly all day conning over the papers of the arbitration the old gentleman he said was not altogether satisfied with the award inasmuch as there were certain particulars of fact which he conceived to be mistated especially in regard to a survey affirmed to be made of the mill dam which did not appear in his notes i have no doubt kinsman will be in absolute grief for this untimely cutting short of the law suit in the vigour of its days ned sat beside bel occupied in a low tremulous and earnest conversation until the stars were all shining bright and even then he unwillingly broke his colloquy at my summons our horses had been waiting at the door for the last hour we galloped nearly the whole way back to swallow barn ned rapidly leading the way and striking his whip at the bushes on the road side whistling singing and cutting many antics upon his saddle what the deuce ails you i called out i feel astonishingly active to night said he i could do such deeds and thereupon he put his horse up to full speed the man is possessed said i following however at the same gait that night we did not go to bed until the moon rose which i think chapter x the last minstrel as i do not at all doubt that my reader has by this time become deeply interested in the progress of ned hazard s love affairs and as i find what greatly surprises myself that ned has grown to be a hero in my story and that i who originally began to write only a few desultory sketches of the old dominion have unawares and without any premeditated purpose absolutely fallen into a regular jogtrot novel like narrative at least for several consecutive chapters it is no more than what i owe to posterity to go on and supply such matters of fact as may tend to the elucidation and final clearing up of the present involved and uncertain posture into which i have brought my principal actors feeling the weight of this obligation as soon as i had closed the last chapter i began to bethink me of the best means of

she was sensible he was watching her countenance for every now and then she opened the day wore slowly away the sun went down and the still twilight came on nothing was heard but the ticking of the watch telling him with a resistless power that the hour was drawing nigh he gasped as if under some invisible gigantic grasp which it was not for human strength to struggle against it was now quite dark and by the pale light of the night lamp in the chimney corner the furniture in the room threw huge and uncouth figures over the walls all was unsubstantial and visionary and the shadowy ministers of death appeared gathering round waiting the duty of the hour appointed them arthur shuddered for a moment with superstitious awe but the solemn elevation which a good man feels at the sight of the dying took possession of him and he became calm again the approach of death has so much which is exalting that our grief for the time is forgotten and could one who had seen arthur a few hours before now have countenance he would hardly have known him the livid hue of death was fast spreading over his mother s face he stooped forward to catch the sound of her breathing it grew quick and faint my mother she opened her eyes for the last time upon him and a faint flush passed over her cheek there was the serenity of an angel in her look her hand just pressed his it was all over his spirit had endured to its utmost it sunk down from its unearthly height and with his face upon his mother s pillow he wept like a child he arose with a softened grief and stepping into an adjoining chamber spoke to his aunt it is past said he is my sister asleep well be it so let her have rest she needs it he then went to his own chamber and shut himself in it is a merciful itself a relief violent grief brings on a torpor and indistinctness as from long watching it is not till the violence of affliction has subsided and gentle and soothing thoughts can find room to mix with our sorrow and holy consolations can minister to us that we are able to know fully our loss and see clearly what has been torn away from our affections it was so with arthur unconnected thoughts with melancholy but half formed images were floating in his mind and now and then a gleam of light would pass through it as if he had been in a troubled trance and all was right again his worn and tired feelings at last found rest in sleep it is an impression which we can not rid ourselves of if we would when sitting by the body of a friend that he has still a consciousness of our presence that though the common concerns of the world have no more to do with him he has still a love and long been familiar with when it was all life and motion seems only in a state of rest we know not how to make it real to ourselves that in the body before us there is not a something still alive arthur was in such a state of mind as he sat alone in the room by his mother the day after her death it was as if her soul was holding communion with pure spirits in paradise though it still abode in the body that lay before him he felt as if sanctified by the presence of one to whom the other world had been laid open as if under the love and protection of one made holy the religious reflections that his mother had early taught him gave him strength a spiritual composure stole over him and he found himself prepared to perform the last offices to the dead is it not enough to see our friends die and part with them for the rest of our days to reflect that they will never look on us again to see that turning to corruption which was but just now alive and eloquent and beautiful with the sensations of the soul are our sorrows so sacred and peculiar as to make the world as vanity to us and the men of it as strangers and shall we not be left to our afflictions for a few hours must we be brought out at such a time to the concerned or careless gaze of those we know not or be made to bear the formal proffers of consolation from acquaintances who will go away and forget it all shall we not be suffered for a little while a holy and healing communion with the dead must the kindred stillness and gloom of our dwelling be changed for the show of the pall the talk of the passers by and the broad and piercing light of the common sun must the ceremonies of the world wait on us even to the open graves of our friends when the hour eye though his face was tremulous with the struggle within him he went to his sister and took her arm within his the bell struck its heavy undulating sound rolled forward like a sea he felt a violent beating through his frame which shook him so that he reeled it was but a momentary weakness he moved on passing those who surrounded him as if they had been shadows while he followed the slow hearse there was a vacancy in his eye as it rested on the coffin which showed him hardly conscious of what was before him his spirit was with his mother s as he reached the grave he shrunk back and turned deadly pale but dropping his head upon his breast and drawing his hat over his face he stood motionless as a statue till the service was

and with all our vaunted improvements in stage decoration how much worse off was the poor athenian company for their lion and wall and moonshine than the unfortunate modern scene painter or property man who is called upon by the text to furnish a bank as per order i know a bank whereon the wild thyme blows where ox lips and the nodding violet grows quite over canopied with lush woodbine with sweet musk roses and with eglantine there sleeps titania no there are scenes and materials about the tempest which may in some slight degree excuse its introduction on the stage and atone for the manifold barbarities committed upon it when there but never let the midsummer night s dream fret work of an ethereal imagination have a tangible existence let us pass to the common acting plays macbeth you are sitting by the fire on a winter s evening wrapped in the perusal of this masterpiece of nature s masterpiece preparatory to visiting the theatre to see it played in your mind s eye you perceive the blasted heath the scene of macbeth s temptation sterile and wild covered with masses of primeval and herbless granite and untenanted save by the lonely plover or shy and solitary moorcock beside some rude cairn are clustered the weird sisters posters of the sea and land recounting their exploits and holding devilish consultation in the distance is the army of macbeth there is a bleak and gloomy grandeur in the picture you have drawn and you hasten to the theatre to have it realized does not your enthusiasm receive a shock before you is some old confined wood scene used on all occasions divers illdrilled supernumeraries huddled together in most unseemly proximity while the hags so wither d and so wild in their attire are generally represented for what reason managers only know by three low comedians for the most part hearty plump oleaginous personages with whom all sorts of odd out of the way associations are connected in patched red and tartan petticoats and stationed in the full glare of the gas lamps true some of this can not be remedied but much of it might were a tithe part of the money and attention directed towards it that is wasted on some gaud or pantomime and much that is now vulgar common place and ridiculous might by the aid of a little liberality and common sense be rendered grand and impressive but the managers think that shakspeare may be used and abused after any fashion that he has stamina for any thing and they think right though they act wrong scenery machinery dresses and decorations yet but alas what mental millwright what skilful machinist will put in order and wind up the talking machines that do the subordinate parts about the theatre to the true shaksperian pitch and set them a going for the night is the schoolmaster yet abroad ordained to shed a ray of light upon their benighted understandings concerning the meaning of the author or make them sensible of the simple but important fact that blank verse is not prose and ought to be spoken differently here it is where our great dramatic poet principally suffers the exuberant genius of shakspeare could not stoop to petty calculations it never entered into his thoughts what unimaginative pieces of mortality would in after times give utterance to the glorious poetry that is scattered indiscriminately over his pages small occasion had he to play the niggard and carefully apportion out his sweet fancies and rare conceits to those who would be likely to give the most effect in the representation and hence it is that the plodding gentlemen with small salaries and corresponding capacities who in other authors have language admirably adapted to their modes of thinking and expression put into their mouths have frequently when doing their work in subordinate characters in shakspeare to utter passages redolent with beauty which they do in a way that very satisfactorily shows these imperfect speakers have little occasion to thank the gods for having made them poetical of all shakspeare s characters there are not any so systematically ill used as these same witches in macbeth it has been thought by many who know something of the matter that there are a wildness and sublimity in the character and attributes of those malignant hags that are perfectly inapproachable by any one below shakspeare s calibre and be it noted they are not only of wondrous import of themselves but the mainspring of all the principal events in the great drama to which they belong the talent and intellect of the greatest ornaments the stage has produced would not be strange and fantastical creations yet what are they at present three old women absolute objects of mockery and laughter to the audience nay this seems in some degree to be now their legitimate purpose for it is not unfrequently the case that when the spectators are more decorous than usual some of the witches by a grotesque action or ridiculous intonation appeal to them for the customary tribute a hearty laugh but it is not always the actors who are in fault there is one thing which has always especially moved my admiration it is the marvellous small provocative to laughter which people require when congregated together in large bodies and when it is quite clear they should do any earthly thing rather than laugh here for instance where the most solemn attention and breathless anxiety should pervade the house first
mingling their delicate green with the deep hues of the early summer grain the whole landscape had a fresh breezy look it was not hedged in from the highways but seemed to welcome him with open arms i felt less a stranger in the land and as my eye traced the dusty road winding along through a rich cultivated country and skirted on either side with blossomed fruit trees and occasionally caught glimpses of a little farm house resting in a green hollow and lapped in the bosom of plenty i felt that i was in a prosperous hospitable and happy land i had taken my seat on top of the diligence in order to have a better view of the country it was one of those ponderous vehicles which totter slowly along the paved roads of france laboring beneath a mountain of trunks and bales of all descriptions and like the trojan horse bore a groaning multitude within it it was a curious and cumbersome machine resembling the bodies of three coaches placed upon one carriage with a cabriolet on top for outside passengers on the pannels of each door were painted the fleurs de lis of france and upon the side gnrale des messageries royales des diligences pour le havre rouen et paris it would be useless to describe the motley groups that filled the four quarters of this little world there was the dusty tradesman with green coat and cotton umbrella the sallow invalid in skull cap and cloth shoes the priest in his cassock the peasant in his frock and a whole family of squalling children my fellow travellers on top were a gay subaltern with fierce mustaches and a nut brown village beauty of sweet sixteen the subaltern wore a military undress and a little blue cloth cap in the shape of a cow bell trimmed smartly with silver lace and cocked on one side of his head the brunette was decked out with a staid white norman cap nicely starched and plaited and nearly three feet high a rosary and cross about her neck a linsey woolsey gown and wooden shoes the personage who seemed to rule this little world with absolute sway was a and the sonorous title of monsieur le conducteur as insignia of office he wore a little round fur cap and fur trimmed jacket and carried in his hand a small leathern port folio containing his way bill he sat with us on top of the diligence and with comic gravity issued his mandates to the postillion below like some petty monarch speaking from his throne in every dingy village we thundered through he had a thousand commissions to execute and to receive a package to throw out on this side and another to take in on that a whisper for the landlady at the inn a love letter and a kiss for her daughter and a wink or a snap of his fingers for the chamber maid at the window then there were so many questions to be asked and answered while changing horses every body had a word to say it was monsieur le conducteur here monsieur le conducteur there he was in complete bustle till at length we lumbered away in a cloud of dust but what most attracted my attention was the grotesque appearance of the postillion and the horses he was a comical looking little fellow already past the heyday of life with a thin sharp countenance to which the smoke of tobacco and the fumes of wine had given the dusty look of wrinkled parchment he was equipped in a short jacket of purple velvet set off with a red collar and adorned with silken cord tight pantaloons of bright yellow leather arrayed his pipe stem legs which were swallowed up in a huge pair of wooden boots iron fastened and armed with long rattling spurs his shirt collar was of vast dimensions and between it and the broad brim of his high bell crowned varnished hat projected an eel skin queue with a little tuft of frizzled hair like a powder puff at the end bobbing up and down with the motion of the rider and scattering a white cloud around him the horses which and leather and in the most uncouth manner imaginable they were five in number black white and gray as various in size as in color their tails were braided and tied up with wisps of straw and when the postillion mounted and cracked his heavy whip off they started one pulling this way another that one on the gallop another trotting and the rest dragging along at a scrambling pace between a trot and a walk no sooner did the vehicle get comfortably in motion than the postillion throwing the reins upon his horse s neck and drawing a flint and steel from one pocket and a short stemmed pipe from another leisurely struck fire and began to smoke ever and anon some part of the rope harness would give way monsieur le conducteur from on high would thunder forth an oath or two a head would be popped out at every window half a dozen voices exclaim at once what s the matter usual thrust his long whip into the leg of his boot leisurely dismount and drawing a handful of packthread from his pocket quietly set himself to mend matters in the best way possible in this manner we toiled slowly along the dusty highway occasionally the scene was enlivened by a group of peasants driving before them a little ass laden with vegetables for a neighboring market then we would pass a solitary shepherd sitting by the road side with a shaggy dog at his feet guarding his flock and making his scanty meal on the contents of his wallet or perchance a little peasant girl in wooden shoes leading a cow by a cord attached to her horns to browse along the side of

the same year he was employed in negotiations with the duke of savoy he seems to have been fitted by nature for scenes of political manoeuvering and his principles were of such any service which the times required in he visited the french king on public business and communicated his instructions in latin in he was appointed minister to holland in march while in that country in order to show his zeal and love for his majesty he procured the arrest of john okey miles corbet and john barkstead three of the judges who had condemned to death charles i and sent them to england for trial okey had been the friend of downing who served in his regiment as chaplain with the other two he had co operated in the cause of the parliament his conduct therefore in this transaction was justly reprobated he also spake of cromwell as a traitor and rebel in he was created a baronet he informed pepys that when in holland he had so good spys that he hath had the keys taken out of de witt s the dutch minister pocket when he was abed and left in his hands for an hour and carried back and laid in the place again and the keys put into his pocket he says he hath had their most private debates that have been between but two or three of them brought to him and in an hour after that hath sent word thereof to the king in he was again sent to holland but returning before he had executed the business

daily with the best of us and the least fortunate how few of us ever dream of the narrow escapes we make at moments when a breath might kill us when the pressure of a bare bodkin is all that is necessary to send us to sudden judgment and the outlaw was again defeated he had not perhaps been scared he had only been surprised been confounded in the first cry of the bird the first rush of his wings flapping through the trees it seemed as if they had swept across his eyes he lowered the pistol involuntarily he forgot to pull the trigger and when he recovered himself steed and rider had gone beyond his reach is there a devil he involuntarily murmured that stands between me and my victim am i to be baffled always is in stupor and vexation he could hear the distant tramp of the horse sinking faintly out of hearing that i who have lived in the woods all my life should have been startled by an owl and at such a moment cursing the youth s good fortune not less than his own weakness the fierce disappointment of guy rivers was such that he fairly gnashed his teeth with vexation at first he thought to dash after his victim but his own steed had been fastened near the cottage several hundred yards distant and he was winded too much for a further pursuit that night colleton was meanwhile a mile ahead going forward swimmingly never once dreaming of danger he was thus far safe so frequently and completely had his enemy been baffled in the brief progress of a single night that he was almost led to believe for like most criminals he was not without his superstition that his foe was under some special guardianship with chapter xxv subdued agonies the entrance of guy rivers awakened no emotion among the inmates of the dwelling indeed at the moment it was almost unperceived the young woman happened to be in close attendance upon her parent for such the invalid was and did not observe his approach while he stood at some little distance from the couch surveying the scene the old lady was endeavoring though with a feebleness that grew more apparent with every breath to articulate something to which she seemed to attach much importance in the ears of the kneeling girl who with breathless attention seemed desirous of making it out but in vain and signifying by her countenance the disappointment which she felt the speaker with something like anger shook her skinny finger feebly in her face and the broken and incoherent words with rapid effort but like success endeavored to find their way through the half closed aperture between her teeth the tears fell fast and neither sobbed nor spoke but with continued and yet despairing attention endeavored earnestly to catch the few words of one who was on the eve of departure and the words of whom at such a moment almost invariably acquire a value never attached to them before as the sounds of a harp when the chords are breaking are said to articulate a sweet sorrow as if in mourning for their own fate the outlaw all this while stood apart and in silence although perhaps but little impressed with the native solemnity of the scene before him he was not so ignorant of what was due to humanity and not so unfeeling in reference to the parties here interested as to seek to disturb its progress or propriety with tone look or gesture which might make either of them regret his presence becoming impatient however of a colloquy which as he saw that it had not its use and was only productive of mortification to one of he advanced toward them and his tread for the first time warned them of his presence with an effort which seemed supernatural the dying woman raised herself with a sudden start in the bed and her eyes glared upon him with a threatening horror and her lips parting disclosed the broken and decayed teeth beneath ineffectually gnashing while her long skinny fingers warned him away all this time she appeared to speak but the words were unarticulated though from the expression of every feature it was evident that indignation and reproach made up the entire amount of everything she had to express the outlaw was not easily influenced by anger so impotent as this and from his manner of receiving it it appeared that he had been for some time accustomed to a reception of a like kind from the same person he approached the young girl who had now risen from her knees and spoke to her in words of comparative kindness well am glad to see you have suffered no injury how happened the fire the young woman explained the cause of the conflagration and narrated in brief the assistance which had been received from the stranger but i was so terrified guy she added that i had not presence of mind enough to thank him and what should be the value of your spoken thanks ellen the stranger if he have sense must feel that he has them and the utterance of such things had better be let alone but how is the old lady now i see she loves me no better than formerly she is sinking fast guy and is now incapable of speech before you came she seemed desirous of saying something to me but she tried in vain to speak and now i scarcely think her conscious believe it not ellen she is conscious of all that is going on though now fixed upon me and with the old expression she would tear me if she could oh think not thus of the dying guy of her who has never harmed and would never harm you if she had the power and yet heaven knows and we both know

right the former were marched in compact order directly up the face of the hill not a trumpet or a drum disturbing the silence of the funerallike procession the various colours of their plumes as they waved in the night breeze and the occasional glitter of burnished arms as a flash of light fell athwart the solid phalanx from the flickering fires above presented one of the most striking scenes imaginable general bacon assumed the immediate command of his columns in person he sat upon his impatient charger on the right wing and examined the ominous appearance of the enemy s camp with intense interest not a warrior s head was to be seen above the breastwork as they approached all was silent gloomy and portentous not a sound was heard as they moved through the bushes once indeed he thought he heard the wild shrill scream of a female very different in its intonations from the harsh voice of the savage squaw but so many unearthly sights and sounds had haunted both his sleeping and waking hours of late that he drove the impression from his mind to rest with hundreds of others of like import when the front lines had arrived within some forty yards of the dark and frowning breastwork a sudden and momentary check was given to their farther progress a rushing sound as of the flight of many birds and the clatter of indian arrows against their arms and persons simultaneously struck upon their senses followed by the fall of many soldiers and the short nvoluntary exclamations of pain which from the impulse of the moment escaped the unfortunate individuals trumpets and drums instantaneously broke the stillness of the march their martial notes reverberated over the surrounding solitudes in enlivening peals the ill omened birds of night flapped their scene in utter dismay at this untimely invasion of their prescriptive dominions these were quickly followed by a discharge of musketry poured into the formidable palisade it was scarcely discharged however before bacon discovered the utter uselessness of such a waste of ammunition he saw that the breastwork was so constructed that while it admitted of the discharge of missiles from within it afforded a secure protection to its occupants against the musketry of their assailants in the mean time his soldiers were exposed to the murderous discharges of poisoned arrows in this emergency no time was to be lost placing himself therefore at the head of his troops he ordered the walls to be torn down these as before related were composed of large trees piled one upon another with their green boughs still protruding in many places over the shallow intrenchment and the earth excavated from the latter thrown up on the outside agaist a rude wicker work of fine bushes filling up the interstices of the moved at a quick pace to the onset still not a savage head was seen until they had arrived at the very borders of the intrenchment here some two hundred of the stoutest and ablest bodied of his soldiers were marched up to the projecting limbs of the largest tree forming the basis of the breastwork bacon saw at a glance that if he could manage to seize hold of these projecting arms and turn the tree across the fosse it would at once open the way for his mounted troops and perhaps carry with it some forty or fifty feet of the palisade and thereby bring the opposing armies face to face they had already seized the projecting limbs and were shaking the frail protection of the savages to its very foundations when simultaneously a thousand lights gleamed over forest hill and dale a thousand voices united their shrill clamours in one deafening yell of savage ferocity the troops engaged in tearing down the breastwork instinctively loosed their hold and flew to their arms these blinding lights and deafening noises came it was but the work of an instant for little more time were they permitted to examine they were called upon to act and that vigorously for their own preservation in a single instant and apparently at a given signal the whole of the rude terrace surmounting the fortification literally swarmed with painted warriors each bearing in his left hand a pine torch and in the other a tomahawk a war club or a battle axe they sprang from their commanding position into the midst of their assailants and scattered themselves in every direction through that part of the army already advanced to the breastwork human ingenuity could not have devised a mode of warfare better calculated to suit their numbers position time courage and limited means of resistance it at once rendered the mounted troops useless prevented the colonists from using their fire arms because those immediately engaged were at too close quarters while those at a greater distance were as likely to blows with wonderous rapidity and precision and though the hardy planters in the front ranks turned upon them with the butt ends of their muskets the savages had evidently the advantage the blazing fagots were often thrust into the very faces of their opponents and while writhing under the confusion and agony of the fire and smoke they were stricken down like helpless beasts bacon saw the imminent peril of his troops and though he was at first astounded by the rapidity and daring courage with which the plan was executed he did not despair nor yet sit listlessly upon his horse to see his friends and countrymen slaughtered he saw at a glance too that only the front columns were engaged that a part of these must now necessarily fall but he determined at the same time that their deaths should be dearly avenged and his remaining troops brought off victorious he immediately placed himself between the forces already engaged and those rushing to the rescue the latter he wheeled into line immediately in to the flank of the contending

the latitude of eighteen north and one hundred and fifteen degrees west of greenwich consequently she was in the pacific ocean and not far from the west coast of mexico the north east trade wind which is generally almost due east was sufficiently free to allow her to carry her starboard studding sails under which she flew gracefully and swiftly on her appointed course the weather as usual within the limits of either trade wind was extremely beautiful and mild the heat that on shore in the same latitude would have been excessive was moderated by the refreshing breeze indeed it has never been my lot to find such lovely weather we meet with through the whole course of the trade winds the long regular swell so peculiar to that part of the ocean gave the noble ship a peculiarly easy rolling motion extremely grateful to a seaman as the regularity and length of the swell is a certain indication of a continuance of good weather as she lifted her huge bows above the foaming sparkling wave her bright copper polished by dashing so long and so fast through the water flashed in the sunbeams like burnished gold at the same time her temporary and partial elevation above the surface revealed a sharpness of model below the water s edge that at once accounted for the graceful and majestic swiftness of her motion the whiteness of her canvass and her bright varnished sides sufficiently indicated her to be a yankee without the trouble of hoisting the gridiron her stern flared a great deal that is its outline formed a very acute angle with the horizon it was ornamented with a great profusion of carved work some of which was hieroglyphical to a degree that would have puzzled champollion but over the centre were two figures in bas relief that could not well be mistaken inasmuch as the sword and scales plainly indicated that the one on the starboard side was justice while the cap on the point of a lance seemed to fructify that her companion was no other than miss liberty liberty goes bare headed now our rulers wisely reflecting that she is upwards of fifty years old and has arrived at years of discretion have ordered her to leave off her child s cap there are among us those who think that the stripping will go further and that in a short time she will be as bare as eve the noses of both goddesses had been knocked off shortly after they condescended to mount guard on the stern of the good ship albatross in consequence of coming into frequent collision with the gunwale of the her station at the stern davits at her quarter davits on each side hung one of those light swift and somewhat singularly shaped boats called whale boats eight iron nine pounders on each side thrust their black muzzles through their respective ports and gave her in spite of her bright varnished sides a warlike appearance the upper part of her cut water was fashioned into a scroll like the volute of an ionic pillar forming what is called by naval architects a billet head and which for its neatness and beauty is very generally adopted both in national vessels and merchantmen nor was the bow without its share of hieroglyphics on one side were displayed a bee hive a bale of cotton and a crate of crockery and on the other a globe an anchor a quadrant and a chart partly unrolled her royals were set flying a technicality that i shall not attempt to explain she had no flying jib nor in port to make a ship look more like the devil than she otherwise would and are always sent down and stored away when she goes to sea ships forty years since carried no spars aloft but such as were stout enough to carry sail upon in fair weather or foul sliding gunter sky sail masts and other useless sticks were as much unknown to ship builders and riggers as railroads and steam boats sitting upon the weather hen coop attached to the companion or entrance to the cabin with spectacles on nose and a well worn bible on his knees sat an elderly man the commander of the ship he was tall and very strongly built long exposure to the weather in every variety of climate had bronzed his countenance and given him an older look than his real years would have done under other circumstances but at the same time long exposure to the weather had hardened his frame and strengthened his constitution points of some importance forty life were much better than those of a man of forty especially one of modern date who had never allowed the winds of heaven to visit his face too roughly his age was in short about sixty his countenance notwithstanding the rude and ungenteel manner with which the winds and the weather had treated it was indicative of much good nature and benevolence of disposition he raised his head from time to time looked aloft at the sails occasionally addressed a word or two to the mate of the watch who was walking fore and aft the quarter deck and then resumed his reading in the weather mizen shrouds was a remarkably handsome young man of four or five and twenty busily engaged in hanging out to air his go ashore clothes a very common sunday morning occupation at sea when the weather is fine apparently the sight of his gay garments had called up a train of ideas of a very varied and checkered hue to judge from the different one moment shaded with anxiety and doubt at another bright with hope and joy in height he was about five feet eight or nine inches strongly and compactly built but far too stout and athletic too broad shouldered and thin flanked to pass muster as an exquisite in broadway
and a sort of wall composed of smaller fragments ran from the one crag to the other yet so rudely that been piled up by the hands of nature or man besides a majestic growth of trees behind and around the rocks there was one tall beech flourishing within the enclosure and from its roots there gushed a cool fountain that went dripping and leaking through green mosses until it yielded its meager tribute to the streamlet both the crags were overgrown with lichens and ferns and under the larger one which in the afternoon cast its shadow over the whole nook there flourished a luxuriant array of arums mandrakes violets and other plants that delight in cool and moist situations on the face and at the foot of the castern rock where the sunshine lingered longer were dusky columbines rock daisies and other plants now in bloom and in the summer their places would have been supplied by the aster and the golden rod and at the foot of the rock among a heap of brambles that seemed to have almost choked it there being obviously of an exotic species it bore a single flower visible among the green leaves and white blossoms of the black berry and it immediately attracted the notice of the maidens elsie told me whispered catherine with a voice of fear that the poor old father planted a rose bush on the grave it is strange it should live so long she said there was a grave stone too ah there it is let us go away as harriet bolder than her friend or affecting to be so reached forward to remove the brier from the more lovely plant in hopes that the rude and thorny veil might conceal other flowers it yielded to her grasp and revealed a hollow or sunken place in the ground at one extremity of which was a rude stone entirely shapeless and undressed yet so placed as to mark undeniably the couch of some human clod of the valley no name letter or device virtues of the dead no legend to perpetuate the grief of the living appeared on the rude monument and indeed however expressive the shape and appearance of the hollow place to those already aware that a grave had been dug in this unsanctified nook it is scarce probable that a stranger stumbling upon it by chance could have believed that in that coarse and dishonoured fragment his foot pressed upon a funeral stone it was a singular grave it was a singular cemetery and the maidens regarded the brambled pit and the solitary flower with awe the one because her spirit was especially susceptible of impressions from melancholy objects and the other because the legend of her companion had invested the place with an interest personal it might be said to herself how little reflection is expended upon yet how much is called for by the grave by the lowliest hillock that is piled over the icy bosom by the grassiest hollow that has sunk with the narrow haven rots the bark that has ploughed the surges of the great vital ocean in this little den that the thistle can overshadow in a day s growth and the molewarp undermine in an hour of labour is crushed the spirit that could enthrall a world and dare even a contest with destiny how little it speaks for the value of the existence which man endures so many evils to prolong how much it reduces the significance of both the pomp and wretchedness of being reducing all its vicissitudes into the indistinguishable identity which infinite distance gives to the stars a point without parallax a speck an atom such is life the gasp of a child that inspires the air of existence but once a single breath breathed from eternity but the destiny that comes behind us oblivion it is not enough that we moralize upon the equality of the sepulchre that the rich man whose soul is in the ostentation of a marble palace should consider how small a pit must content him or that the proud who boast their pre eminence above the beasts should know that the shaggy carcass and the lawn shrouded corse must fatten the earth together we should teach our vanity the lesson of humiliation that is afforded by the grave neglecting the mighty mausoleums of those marvellous spirits which fame has rendered immortal we should turn to the nameless tombs of the million and in their deserted obscurity discover the feeble hold which we ourselves must have upon earth and the memory of men friendship forgets what the devouring earth has claimed and even enmity ceases at last to remember the resting place of a foe love ourselves as we may devote our affections to others as we can yet must our memory perish with us in the grave and all the immortality we leave to be cherished among friends is expressed in the distich of a poet whom the anticipation of enduring renown could not blind to the transitoriness of real remembrance week and arbuthnot a day but there were other thoughts necessarily associated and other feelings excited by this lonely sepulchre and while miss falconer preserved a moody and painful silence upon its brink catherine bent over it scarce conscious that she bedewed the rose bush with a tear or that her own shadow had descended as it were into the pit with an ominous readiness it was a delightful evening the air was full of balmy freshness the landscape resplendently verdant and the sky cloudless save in the west where the sun was sinking among curtains of gold and pillars of flame and the solitude and quiet of the whole scene broken by no sounds except the ceaseless turmoil of the water fall and the plaintive scream of the fishing eagles which had deserted their gray perch to bathe in the pure floods of sunset that

and while thou pitiest me for a shame endured only for thyself endured only that i may requite thee with life for life thou art sorry thy hand ever snatched me from the billows speak juan lerma is it not so it had been better magdalena besides that the act caused me to be stained with blood it afflicts me with a curse still more heavy i do not mourn the death of hilario as i mourn the downfall of one whom i once esteemed almost a seraph villain that he was cried magdalena with vindictive impetuosity mean and malignant in life and in death who with a lie living destroyed the peace and the fame of the friendless and died with a lie that both might remain blighted for ever o wretch o wretch there is no punishment for him among the fiends for he was of their nature and thou mournest his death too thou cursest the hand that avenged the wrong of a feeble woman i lament that i slew the son of my benefactor said juan with a deep sigh and then added with one still deeper but sinner that i am i rejoice while looking on the destroyer of innocence the destroyer of innocence indeed replied magdalena with a voice broken and suffocating yes innocence she exclaimed more wildly or at least the fame of innocence for innocence herself he could not harm no by heaven oh no for what i came from the sea that i am now yes now i tell thee now and if thou darest give tongue to aught else if thou darest think oh heaven this is more than i can bear say juan lerma say dost thou too believe me the thing i am called the base the fallen the degraded alas magdalena replied juan to the wild demand with his dying lips hilario with his dying lips he perjured his soul for ever exclaimed magdalena for ever for ever she went may the curse of a broken hearted woman destroyed by his defaming malice cling to him as long scorching him with fresh torments even when fiends grow relentful and forbearing mountains of fire requite the coals he has thrown upon my bosom may god never forgive him no never never this is horrid said juan revoke thy malediction it is impiety alas alas he continued moved with compassion as the singular being passing at once from a sibyl like rage to the deepest and most feminine abasement of grief wrung her hands and sobbed aloud and bitterly would indeed that thou hadst perished with the others would that i had said magdalena more calmly but thou hadst then been left to a malice like that which has slain me no not like that for it is content with thy life i would ask thee more of myself she went on but it needs not if i can show thee thou wrongest me concerning hilario canst thou not believe i may be even here without stain well i care not one day thou wilt know thou hast wronged me but let the shame rest upon me now for it needs i should think not of myself but of thee listen to me juan lerma for fallen or not yet am i thine only friend among a thousand enemies give up thy service thy hopes of fame and fortune in this land and leave it leave mexico return to the islands thou hast marvellously escaped a death subtly and cruelly designed and now thou art destined to an end as vengeful and perhaps even more inevitable yet there is one way of escape and there is one moment to take advantage of it leave mexico cortes is thy foe leave mexico these are but wild words magdalena said do much to remove thee from a situation the thought whereof is bitterer to me than my own misfortunes wouldst thou said magdalena eagerly go then and i go likewise go then and know that thy departure not only releases me from a situation of disgrace but enables me to make clear a reputation which thou yes thou believest to be sullied and lost i am not what i seem saints of heaven that i should have to say it but by the grave of my mother i swear juan lerma thou doest me as deep a wrong as others leave this land and thou shalt see that the fame of an angel is not purer than mine own scorned name no by heaven no freer from a deserved shame thou shakest thy head i could kill thee juan lerma i could kill thee she went on with a strange mingling of thee for i have not deserved this of thee then changing her tone and clasping her hands submissively she said but think not of me or rather continue to think me unworthy of aught but pity think not above all that what i do is with any reference to myself no heaven is my witness i claim of thee neither affection nor respect i am content to be mistaken to be despised all this i can endure and will uncomplaining so that i can rescue thee from the danger in which thou art placed leave this land don hernan deceives thee he hates thee and thirsts after thy blood he has confessed it god be my help said juan despairingly my life is in his hands if this be true if it be true repeated magdalena it is known to all but thyself it is i have done him no wrong and he is not the detestable being you would make him if he be i owe him a life let him have it it

easily believe pervade the whole of europe but enough the reader of the following pages by which he may find his way through the mazes of this almost forgotten period the ensuing chapters were written immediately after the occurrence of the events to which they relate many of them almost contemporaneously the only judgment i can form of the influence they may exercise on the minds of others is from that which they possess on my own from having perused them this morning distant as is their date and widely as i feel my own character to have been changed in the interim i have returned as it were to the very days of my prime the actors are before my eyes i can hear their voices i can read their countenances it is for this reason that i am unwilling to change a word even for the improvement of the

the blade i may wear away a something of its sterling metal as it is i commit it to the hands of posterity only reminding those who may perchance take it up to kill a heavy hour that the writer was

nature the skies looked blank and dismal there was not a cloud of darker hue not a speck of light however pale to relieve the solid wall of dull gray fog which limited the view to a dozen feet around

preceding night although the motives for my expedition were in the highest degree pressing and important what those motives were employed as i now am in the relation of an event which bearing in no single point upon any portion of my past time produced effects the most striking on my after life i am not at present inclined to relate nor is it probable that my readers would find much either of profit or of pleasure in the perusal of occurrences so intimately connected with facts which have already become history as to baffle all attempts at unravelling them from the skein in which their humble thread is blended suffice it to say i education association or prejudice if you will a cavalier yes with my eyes fully open to the danger and iniquity of those arbitrary doctrines whether of

in every skirmish from the first unfolding of the banners of rebellion to the final triumph of the commonwealth on the scaffold of whitehall an ardent adorer of freedom in the abstract i had lent all

those splendid associations by that almost religious veneration for ancient institutions merely because they are ancient and by that false glare of nobility of accomplishment and of chivalrous royal cause behind a halo no less delusive than it was brilliant i had surrendered my mind to the romantic rather than to the rational the cry of patriotism was no less alive in the mouths of one than of

rushed out into the nightly camp it was already long past midnight so long a time had i an hour of the time appointed for the movement of the troops they were already stirring i hurried to the quarters of d erlach commanded him to hasten his arrangements i passed among the men with a word of encouragement a word of heart stirring praise to each and all my very being was set upon the cast and win or die it should be played for nobly not a torch was kindled not a trumpet blown the orderlies of the arquebusiers alone bore darkened lanterns whence to distribute fire for the matchlocks when the time should arrive silently steadily but cheerily withal did the men meet and muster the very horses seemed to trample with less sound than usual on the bruised and broken turf as if they too were conscious that there was need of caution for the last time before i mounted i returned to my quarters i steeped my burning brow in the pure element i threw aside my doublet and bathed my strong arms for i felt that contrary to my wont my nerves were shaken and i was resolved that nothing should be left to chance which might be secured by care i renewed the flints in the newly invented locks of my best pistols i passed my poniard ay and my rapier once and again across the hissing whetstone i bound a strong spiked collar on the neck of the stanch bloodhound and in the ardour of my feelings i apostrophized the noble brute i conversed with him as though he were a rational and thoughtful being i told him that he should follow me to the field that he should fight in the strife of men for his master s bride and by the heaven that is above me i believe he marked and understood my words his full bright eye read my features as i spoke and as i ended he feathered his long stern stooped his

of the forest the moon was setting but her light faint and uncertain as she waded through the fleeting clouds came and went in fitful gleams over the dense woodlands and the grassy glades there was no sound or stir all seemed peaceful and at rest it was my object fully to occupy the woods in the rear of the nunnery before giving any alarm in order to cut off the possibility of flight to or succour from the army of lorraine this done i had resolved to invest the building on every side and to obtain admission peaceably if possible but if not by any means with this view i
extensively cultivated as now when to the tauconnuc on the south and the lofty blue outline of the catskills on the west the eye ranges over a rich and enjoyed country beside the accidental charm of a pretty landscape the inn had advantages peculiar to itself instead of being placed on the roadside as most of our taverns are for what reason we know not unless a cloud of travellers dust be typical of a shower of gold to the vision of mine host reynolds s inn was separated from the highway by a court yard shaded by two wide spreading elms and enlivened with a profusion of autumnal flowers marigolds cockscombs and china asters there was nothing that indicated any claims to particular civility in the appearance of our travellers they were well looking and respectably to remain for the night they were shown to an inner room the parlour par excellence where mrs reynolds appeared and having opened a door which admitted the balmy air and a view of the western sky just then brightened by the tints of the setting sun she received their orders for their supper and retired without one of those remarks or inquiries by which it is usual on such occasions to give vent to curiosity nothing passed between our travellers in the dull interval that elapsed before their meal was ready to give to our readers the least clue to their origin or destiny one of them lulled himself into a doze in the rocking chair while the other younger and more active and vivacious amused himself out of doors plucking flowers enraging an old petulant cock turkey and mocking the scolding of some guinea hens the xantippes of the feathered race the interval was not long the door opened and the tea table was brought in from our pattern landlady and spread in a manner to characterize our bountiful country what a contrast does the evening meal of our humblest inn present to the leanness of an english tea table a cornucopia would have been the appropriate symbol for mrs reynolds s table there were beef steaks and ham and eggs hot cakes and toast bread and gingerbread all the indigenous cakes such as crullers and nuteakes c honey sweet meats apple sauce cheese pickles and an afterpiece of pies kind reader do not condemn our bill of fare as impertinent and vulgar we put it down to show the scared political economists that with us instead of the population pressing on the means of subsistence the means of subsistence presses on the population our travellers fell to their repast with appetites whetted by a long fast and a day s ride not a word was spoken till a little girl who was sitting on the doorstep caressing a tame pigeon buttonhole with a bunch of marigolds plucked a rose from a monthly rose bush trained over a trellis at the door and laid it beside his plate he seemed struck with the modest offering and turning with a look of gratitude to the child he patted her on her head and exclaimed instinctively merci merci ma petite and then correcting himself he said in very imperfect english i thank you my little girl the child s attention was fixed by the first word he uttered and as he addressed his companion in french her countenance indicated more emotion than would naturally have been excited by the simple circumstance of hearing for the first time a foreign language qu elle est belle cette petite he continued turning to his companion c est la beaute de mon pays voila brunette et les yeux si grands si noirs et la tournure aussi quelle grce quelle fran oise as he proceeded the child advanced nearer to him she shook back the rich dark curls that shaded her face bent her head forward half parted her bright lips and listened with the uncertain and eager expression of one who is catching a half remembered tune the key to a thousand awakening recollections it was evident that she did not comprehend the purport of the words and that it was the sound alone to which her delighted ear was stretched a smile played about her lips and tears gathered in her eyes and there seemed to be a contrariety of emotions confounding even to herself but that which finally prevailed was indicated by her throwing her apron over her head and retreating to the doorstep where she sat down and for some moments vainly attempted to stifle her sobs she had just become tranquil when mrs reynolds entered the elder traveller said in an interrogating tone that is your child ma am not very satisfactory reply she resembles neither you nor your husband resumed the traveller no she does not favour us i fancied she had a french look i ca nt say as to that replied the landlady i never saw any french people my friend here is a frenchman pursued the traveller and the little girl listened to him so intently that i thought it possible she might understand him no i guess she did not sense him replied mrs reynolds with an air of indifference and then turning hastily to the child mary she said there is more company go and see if your father does not want you she went and did not return mrs reynolds herself removed the table the elder gentleman sat down to write a letter while the frenchman walked to and fro opened the doors and peeped in who seemed to have taken complete possession of his imagination once as she ran through the passage he called to her doucement doucement mon petit ange she stopped as if she were glued to the floor how call you your name my dear mary reynolds sir then madame there mistress reynolds is your maman she is mary what are you staying for here this instant screamed mrs reynolds from the
fight one or two offered resistance boldly and with as much skill as resolution but they were soon overpowered as they received no support from their comrades who were now scampering in the bushes in every direction the surprise had been complete not a man was seriously hurt among the whigs while every rifle fired in the first of the fray slain outright a few more sabred and some few were made prisoners the rest took the back track into the woods and though pursued contrived with few exceptions to make their escape the boy meanwhile had well performed the other duty which had been given to his charge the conflict pellmell had scarcely begun when slipping noiselessly round to the hollow where the prisoners were confined so as not to arouse the notice of the two sentinels having them in custody and whose eyes were now turned in surprise upon the unlooked for contest he cut the cords which bound them and prompt as himself they were no sooner free than they seized upon their guards and disarmed them the ropes were transferred to other hands than their own this was all the work of an instant so indeed was the affray itself and the first object that met the eyes of singleton as he returned from the charge to the spot where it over the man he had shot and curiously inspecting the bullet hole which he had made through and through his forehead ha boy said singleton you have done well you have behaved like a man oh sir tell me cried the boy was this the man that was swearing so but a minute ago and can this be the bullet hole from my rifle it is this is the wretch and your bullet was in the right time oh sir he was cursing when i fired and then the poor man he was going to hang i was so afraid that you would not say now soon enough to save him but i feel so strange how boy i have killed a man what would my poor mother say if she was alive and knew it go go boy you good cause and have saved innocent life besides you could not have done better but do nt think of it i ca nt help thinking of it sir said the boy upon whom a new experience was dawning rapidly as he moved back to the copse where he had been concealed to resume his jacket and rifle which he had there thrown aside in another quarter of the field the scene which met the eye of singleton was one of those which amply compensate for the pain and the peril the dread and the anxiety through which men must pass to witness them the sudden emancipation of the prisoners to life and freedom the erect aspect of the beaten and bound man the body realizing in the moment of its rescue the liberty for which the mind had been yearning and whose value can only be duly estimated by its privation a cry a cheer of joy was upon every lip as the bird his new condition of freedom in song not less than flight conspicuous among the prisoners in their joy upon this occasion was the family of the brave but suffering wretch who had so narrowly escaped the halter revived by the noise the rush the firing and confusion of the fight as much as by the earnest cares of her daughter his wife had been filled with a new anxiety along with the new hope when she found that though execution had not been done upon her husband as so nearly promised her eyes could not trace out his person in the midst of the fierce mele which followed the first arrest of his doom a moment after and her arms were about his neck and though unused to the melting mood the tears forced themselves into the eyes of singleton as he surveyed their meeting the sweetness of their sorrow the joy which is tearful the pleasure which almost grows into pain in the depth of walter griffin and there is no more danger my husband none none we are safe we are all safe ellen and where is gaskens the wretch is on his back god bless the bullet that came in time and the true hand that sent it and we are free my father to go home again to our own home said the daughter as she took the hand of her father in both of her own home where is it he exclaimed fiercely and with the same savage expression with which his eyes had regarded gaskens even in the moment of his greatest danger where is it did you not see the blaze through the trees as we looked back did he not throw the torch into the loft with his own accursed hands and yet you ask for our home we have no home girl but we you will go to work we will soon have another in the old place and we can lodge in a shed till then never never i do no such folly what to be burnt down again by other tories no no i am chopped already i can not be chopped much worse and live and if i must suffer let me suffer with those who will help me to strike too and to revenge i will burn too i will kill too i will have blood for what i have lost and the sufferings of others shall pay me for my own and yours singleton approached at this moment and the prisoners so lately freed gathered around him each had his own story of affliction to tell and each more mournful than the other they chased me it mought be a matter of three miles fore i gin up captain and they wore out run see to the

very lamps which hang from the walls are composed of bones and the same material distributed most fantastically furnishes meet accompanying ornaments perhaps this kind of burial if such it may be called is one of the rarest when an interment takes place must be impressive in the extreme though with the broad light of day shining through the windows the scene seemed more hideous than morally striking nor can one easily feel that the intended honour is conferred upon the unbroken skeletons by permitting them to stand holding a card upon which is inscribed the name and age of the deceased like guardians of the mournful piles around them in which are merged the remains of their less distinguished brethren the vatican we crossed the tiber in a broad barge and during the few moments which intervened ere our walk re commenced we were naturally led to contrast the turbid waters and the dim earth around us with the same scene in its transcendent aspect as existing in the familiar picture of our fancy the one was the plain appearance of neglected and perhaps degenerate nature the other impressions derived from nature s glowing commentator the poet passing by a retired path through the fields we soon came in st angelo now chiefly used as a prison but originally the tomb of hadrian and certainly when its solid proportions were decked with the numerous statuary ornaments which once adorned them it must have formed a glorious final resting place for a roman there is a striking and melancholy inconsistency observable in this as in many instances in the modern appropriation of ancient monuments so much more honourable is it to the general or at least to the better sentiment of mankind to leave unmarred the few remnants of a nation s greatness when not one of her children exists there is surely a kind of sacrilege in disturbing works consecrated to the dead for purposes of selfish pride or narrow utility the beauty the interest the blessed inspiration which so often hallow these ruins are thus invaded while no commensurate advantage is obtained have not as many smiles of ridicule or sneers of reproach as pious feelings been awakened by the view of the apostle s figures who can behold without regret the mausoleum of the mighty dead transformed into a tomb for the most wretched of the living we ascended a long flight of steps entered a square and corridor and were soon in the museum of the vatican it were vain to endeavour to describe what an impression of the richness of art is inspired by the first general inspection of this vast collection of her redeemed trophies and far more to paint the vivid and elevating conception of her power which dawns brightens and finally glows in the bosom as face after face of thrilling interest figure after figure of embodied nature and gem after gem of exquisite material or workmanship attracts the admiring eye all unanimated by one spiritual principal and yet so legitimately the offspring of the highest and so perfectly significant as to awaken wonder enkindle delight and finally win love we devoted a season to the inspection and admiration of the time worn frescos which exist upon the walls of the camere a splendid battle piece but of all the figures none struck me as grander than the group representing the miraculous defeat of the ravager of the temple struck down by a cavalier and two angels at the prayer of the priest most of the countenances here depicted are separate and noble studies all the frescos were partially designed and executed by raphael they present a worthy but melancholy monument to his genius impaired as they are by age and marred by his untimely death yet artists of the present day are continually studying these dim though most admirable remains and find in their contemplation the happiest aids and incitements notwithstanding this speaking testimony to departed excellence as well as that which beamed in the admiring looks of the gazers around there was something of sadness in the very air of rooms that bore the name and shone with the embodied talent of the beloved and early dead which forced itself irresistibly upon the mind and tinged with mournfulness the gratified thoughts but the presence of that being if aught destitute of sensation deserve the name it is when the eye first rests and the heart first fastens with instinctive eagerness upon the apollo belvidere that we feel the triumph of human art and there springs up a rich sentiment of satisfaction not only that the poetical in native feeling the pure in taste and the exalted in thought are conscious of unwonted gratification but because we rejoice in the spiritual nobility of our common nature we glory in the thought that the senseless marble radiates the beautiful and deep expressiveness of intellectual life at the call of human genius and we are soothed by the testimony thus afforded to the immortality of what we most love in ourselves and kind for we feel that such followers of nature are allied to its author and may humbly but legitimately aspire to yet higher teachings than are evolved from the physical universe gardens of sallust i entered on a fine clear day the large enclosed tract called beautiful historian s villa and grounds there are a few ill defined ruins here situated supposed to be those of a temple dedicated to venus erycina and of the mansion or its adjuncts the general aspect presented during my wanderings through this extensive enclosure was more in accordance with the idea previously formed of the country than any before obtained the fertility of the grounds green with varied shrubbery and occasionally beautified with field flowers and thickly planted with vegetables among which groups of labourers were actively engaged afforded remarkable evidence of the actual mildness of the climate while occasional glimpses of an old aqueduct
out of ten originate over the bottle it s only your quarrelsome fellows by nature mr cooke or say an uncivil thing not you neither do i if the disposition to quarrel or any ill will towards a companion is in the bosom wine brings it out allen continued the speaker who was hilson allen you know all these matters and things allen is a philosopher mr cooke and his opinion is oracular allen what has caused the greatest number of quarrels and duels within your experience politics was the reply party politics so i thought your politician is a fellow with the hearburn your water drinking politician your lily livered cold blooded office seeking place hunting mischief making tale bearing under mining politician colonel did you ever know a man with a ruby coloured nose and a carmine cheek that ever fought a duel it will be readily imagined that this question was intended by the way to bring on the reply and discussion that followed yes many a and alcort were neither of them chalk faced there was johnson too who was shot by brown had a face as full of claret as your own though it showed through a browner covering of skin colonel you know the particulars of that affair said allen inquiringly as he puffed a volume of smoke towards the man of war yes but they are not to be told it was a bloody business our hero inquired if either fell and looks of intelligence passed from one to the other among the young men who were in the plot spiffard s eyes were fixed on the colonel who answered with a tremendous oath both ought to have been killed ten times over if either could have hit the broad side of a church at ten paces to be sure it was rather late in the evening but there was snow on the ground and that gave light and made a mark surer i remember in the year it was when we were hutted near morristown no colonel not that story but the duel of brown and johnson that was just over the fence to the north of love lane love lane called so said cooke because no love is ever lost there does hoboken mean love in dutch i suppose said allen that brown never fired a pistol before in his life and let me tell you it is no easy matter to keep a muzzle in line no nor would he then said the gruff man of war if he had not been told that his standing with the party and in society depended upon his fighting so the yankees commit murder for fear of losing their reputation as good members of society yes said spiffard it is fear that makes men brave death in many cases the one associates makes many a man expose himself to his adversary s ball or risk the shedding his brother s blood no man said allen taking the cigar from his mouth and breaking off the ashes which had accumulated on the end like the snuff of a burning candle no man and he deliberately placed the brightened cigar on the table the fire end a little over the edge no man and he spoke with emphasis assuming a most oracular air can refuse to fight when challenged if he had provoked the challenge spiffard looked at the oracle with lack lustre eye the upper lid hanging remarkably low his chin elongated and his mouth a little opened he was taken in the snare he had no greater dread of death than is common to humanity and he thought himself principled against duelling yet he began to have a glimpse in imagination of a duel impending and himself one of the parties smile were dancing in mournful measure in his mind when the speaker continued if a gentleman makes use of offensive language to another gentleman and is called upon for an apology he must make it or accept the offended party s challenge if he thinks fit to call him out allen resumed his cigar spiffard look d ruminating he was chewing the cud without that satisfaction which attends it in some of his fellow water drinkers the colonel responded to the oracle s exposition of the law of the duello with certainly and an immense volume of tobacco smoke no doubt said another the conspirators watched the countenance of spiffard and saw the success of their hoax johnson said allen insulted brown brutally and deserved to be shot the colonel with his cigar in his mouth and speaking after puffing off a cloud of smoke observed i believe it is always the case that the repeated spiffard but colonel do you mean the offence that called forth the demand for an apology or the offence first given let me understand your question state a case why as thus if a man reproves another for improper behaviour to a female for example and the person reproved demands an apology it can not be given said the colonel it can not be given said allen certainly not said hilson if continued our hero on refusal of apology a challenge ensues he must fight said the colonel yes said hilson he must fight certainly he must fight said allen as long as the challenger chooses to shoot at him said hilson i knew a case in point said the colonel but the parties fought with us at yorktown but colonel queried the vermonter according to your theory i should suppose that the person giving the offence would in this case be the man whose behaviour had been improper towards the female he would be the offender and not the person who reproved him the reprover being right can not possibly apologize said allen it is pity that one can not be sure where the ball would strike for notwithstanding the colonel s theory who knows
against the rendezvous of the pirates the fair girl whose star of happiness seemed now in the ascendant and about to shine propitiously upon her future life re assumed her reclining attitude by the cabin window which overlooked the sea in the direction of her native land for a few moments her thoughts were engaged upon her approaching bridal but gradually they assumed the garb of memory and winging like a wearied bird over the evening sea reposed in the home of her childhood as she still gazed vacantly upon the fading horizon she was conscious that a dark object broke its even line it grew called from her half conscious abstraction by a change in its appearance when fixing her look more keenly in the direction she saw it was a schooner just rounding to about a mile beyond the frigate apparently it had not as yet been observed from the deck as all eyes were turned to the shore following the boats which had just gained the foot of the cliff at the sight of the vessel so nearly resembling the one whose prisoner she had been her capture and its trying scenes came vividly before her mind and she turned her face from an object connected with such disagreeable associations the approaching ceremony again agitated her bosom and as her eye rested upon a mirror in the opposite pannel she parted with care her dark hair from her forehead arranged in more graceful folds her mantilla and all the woman beamed in her fine eyes as they met the reflection of her lovely countenance and symmetrically moulded figure how long he stays he said unconsciously aloud the virgin protect him from harm the count will soon return ma moiselle said a small mulatto boy who acted as steward of the state rooms now that they were occupied by their fair inmate she turned as he spoke is there danger boy none please you ma moiselle the men on deck say the rovers have left their rock and that there will be no fighting sacra diable he suddenly shrieked pointing to the state room window at which appeared the head of the slave constanza also turned but only to be grasped in his frightful arms at first surprised and too much paralized with fear to scream cudjoe prevented her from giving the alarm by winding her mantilla about her mouth and hastily conveyed her through the window or port hole from which the gun usually stationed there had been removed rapidly letting himself with his burden down her into the sea and raising her head above water with one muscular arm a few vigorous strokes with the other bore him within the black shadow of the rocks behind a projecting point of which he disappeared re entering the hut after the abrupt departure of the slave oula released the spaniard from his place of concealment and informed him of her plan to place the lady in his power you are a very devil for happy thoughts he said with animation but if the revengeful slave gets her i may thank you and not fetish for the prize have her this night i must for i expect my schooner ha there is the juli now by the holy twelve he exclaimed as his quick eye rested upon the object which had attracted the attention of constanza getzendanner will be putting a boat in for me and yet he must see the frigate unless she lays too dark in the cliff s shadow will he bring her to the hut if he succeeds think you oula he suddenly and sharply inquired as a suspicion of change in the negro s purpose flashed across his mind bring de lady she exclaimed in surprize he know he finger rot off he eye fall out and he hair turn to de live snake wid de fang if he no bring her he no dare keep her way solaced by this assurance he paced the little green plat before the cabin often casting his eyes in the direction of the frigate nearly half an hour elapsed after the departure of cudjoe when the robes of the maiden borne in the arms of the slave caught his eye back back you spoil de whole exclaimed oula as the impatient spaniard darted forward to seize his prize instead of the maiden s lovely form he met the herculean shoulders of the slave whose long knife passed directly through his fell dead at his feet resigning the maiden to the faithful juana who followed immediately behind cudjoe sprung forward with a cry of vindictive rage and before oula could comprehend his motives the reeking blade passed through her withered bosom take dis hag ob hell he shouted as he drew forth the knife from her breast you make no more fool ob cudjoe for de curs spaniard grande diable what debble dis he suddenly yelled and groaned as the son of the slain obeah leaped upon his neck when he saw his mother fall and grappled his throat tightly with his fingers while he fixed his teeth deep into his flesh the struggle between them was but for a moment finding it impossible to disengage his fingers the slave bent his arm backward and passed his long knife up through his body the thrust was a skilful one and fatal to the boy who released his grasp and fell the meanwhile juana had borne constanza to the fire in the hut and was using every means to restore circulation to the chilled limbs of the unconscious girl the interview between the spaniard and oula had been overheard by juana from the rock above the hut after the escape of her mistress and the count and the departure of lafitte and his men in pursuit with the exception of cudjoe who in the hurry and confusion of getting underweigh was left behind and with whom she was accustomed
to dissipation of any sort the thought of you would have been a shield to me knowing you and charlotte so well and the memory of my excellent mother have given me a reverence for female virtue a belief in the power and beauty of goodness in a woman and to this susan love naturally follows that pure love that is ordained by god to lead to the holy institution of marriage but what are my thoughts running to go back to my business statements when i began business i took lodgings at a carman s he is a good friend of mine and with him i could live at a small expense in a quiet family i have avoided living or associating with those who had more means than i for that leads to expense i have never spent a shilling on superfluities for which i have now much reason to be thankful for even if i had escaped that dreadful load unpaid debts i might like many other young men have acquired habits of expense on the credit of future gains the gains may not come the habits remain like so many tormentors when i was asked by a friend to go to an oyster house or the theatre or the circus or to take a bottle of porter or drink a glass of whiskey i declined i knew if i did it for my friend s sake this time i might do treats my pleasant thoughts of the time when i should have a table of my own and faces round it that i loved it is sure we ca nt have every thing in this world and the thing is to make up our mind what we must have and what we can do without you can guess my must have when i found finley and i were going behind hand i determined to stop short and not as many do put off the evil day plunging deeper and deeper making enemies and making plenty of work for repentance when our affairs were settled up i had a hundred dollars in my pocket and no one to look me in the face and say i owed him a shilling or had wronged him of one the next thing was to determine on what business i should follow you know my breast was much weakened by sitting over my lapstone when i was growing fast it is a bad trade to put a a farm in one of the free western states seemed to me the happiest lot in the world for a poor man but there were hardships in the beginning and though you and i would not have minded them your father and lottie could not have stood them a farm at essex i dared not think of a man must have some capital and knowledge practice and skill to go ahead in new england on a farm and i had none of these while i was deliberating my good friend mr loomis the carman determined to move to ohio he advised me to take up his business and offered to sell me his horse and cart on very reasonable terms and to recommend me to his employers there were many reasons to decide me to take his advice i find exercise in the open air the best medicine for the pain in my breast carting is a sure and regular business i have observed that the carmen in this city are a healthy cheerful looking class of men they go slowly but surely ahead they can generally manage to take their meals with their families and to spend all their evenings at home a great point to a man who loves home faces and home pleasures as i do some persons think it is going down a step to go from shop keeping to carting but you and i susan have our own notions about going up and down and both think it is what is in a man and not what is out of him that humbles or exalts him some think that most genteel which brings them nearest to being idle gentlemen but when i am driving through broadway on my cart do you think i would change places with those slim looking young men i see parading up and down the street looking like tailors walking advertisements bringing nothing to pass doing nothing with the time god gives them in this world and gives them for what oh i might have gone into trade of some kind but i have not health to be shut up behind a counter and besides in my opinion a shop is a fitting place for women only they being do nt be affronted susy the weaker sex you see now how my case stands i have no debts i have good health for the business i have chosen industry and a faculty i may boast so i think i may marry in this blessed country of ours where there is sure employment and a man is certain of getting his earnings besides dear susan if any thing happens to me you have your trade to depend upon give my best love to charlotte and tell her besides being a main comfort she will be a real help to us for while she is doing the light work your needle will be making money if your father has any scruples about coming pray tell him rent of a room here and save us from near neighbours we may not like am i not calculating susan but is it not better to calculate beforehand than to grumble afterward i am sure i am right so far as i can to secure independence to your father and charlotte and if after all they must take something from us those who are so generous in giving will be also generous in receiving and they will not grudge us the

this long letter balcombe amused himself with a book when i had got through i did not immediately interrupt him for i was glad to steal a moment for my own thoughts at length i remarked that it

to do with one who never sleeps i know it is not sloth that would keep you here but i am much mistaken if your absence has not already served you better than your presence could have done you will lose nothing by that sure and i deceive myself if you do nt find influences exerted in your favour which have been heretofore exerted against you you do nt mean said i to impute mercenary feelings to ann by no means i am not exactly sure of my own meaning nor will i permit myself to be so unless i become convinced that my thoughts do no wrong to others but we must betake ourselves to rest for the way is long to raby hall and we must sleep there to morrow night he now left me and went to his room at an early hour the next morning we were in the saddle the day was pleasant for the season but the roads were deep and we got on but slowly night overtook us when we were yet ten miles from the place of our destination but balcombe knew the road and we had a new moon which promised to give light until we should be within patiently toiled along over ground roughened by a partial thaw which made it difficult for our weary horses to pick their way it was not very far from midnight when we reached the stables which were perhaps a quarter of a mile from the house in passing these we met a negro man of whom balcombe inquired if major swann was at home being answered in the affirmative he asked the negro s name charles sir was the reply what old amy s son charles yes sir and how is your mother charles i thank you sir she been mighty low but miss mary take such good care of her she right well again only just she mighty old master and are you hostler here still charles yes master but master i do nt know who you for all you seems to know all about us i think i should know your s do nt you remember george balcombe the negro clapped his hands and springing into the air alighted with balcombe s hand in both of his to one not accustomed to the negro character their strong attachments and grotesque manner of displaying their feelings the contortions of his dusky figure bowing himself on balcombe s hand then swaying his body back and writhing from side to side like a wounded serpent would have been amusing oh mass george said he i so glad to see you and poor miss mary she be so glad to see you too sir and how is she charles oh thank god she right well sir and mighty comfortable old master and missis here sir mighty good to her but who this you got here with you master this is mr napier charles your old master negro mass william my miss fanny s son oh bless god i live to see him then turning to me he added in a plaintive tone master i been afraid you never was coming to see your poor negroes now we do nt belong to you no more but all gone to strange man that lives away there in england and do nt care nothing at all about us i was mightily in hopes we d all have gone to you sir but you s my master for all that as he spoke this in a tone of reverential affection i held out my hand to him he took it and drawing it strongly downward to accommodate it to the lowliness of his prostration bowed himself upon it and pressed it to his lips i felt a tear upon it and if an answering tear had not sprung to my eye i should have little deserved to be the object of a loyalty as you are as tired of the saddle as i am william said balcombe you will not be sorry to leave our horses with charles and walk to the house i gladly assented to this and balcombe addressing the negro added charles my good fellow take care of our little baggage and bring it up to the house saying this he alighted and we walked on both too busy with our own thoughts for conversation as we approached the house we saw a dusky red light glimmer fitfully from between the bars of a cellar window just as we were about to enter it flashed up brighter than before and
to rest on the same ground it is mere fancy it is a nullity unless it be true as i think it is that it has been the source of great mischiefs to the world in which case it can not be termed a nullity but something positively pernicious what age of the world can be named when an insane devotion to one s country has upon evil beyond the power of memory to recount patriotism standing for this instinctive slavery of the will has cursed as much as it has blessed mankind men have not reasoned they have only felt they have not inquired is the cause of my country just but is it her cause that has ever been the cry in rome our country our country right or wrong our country it is a maxim good for conquest and despotism bad for peace and justice it has made rome mistress of the world and at the same time the scourge of the world and trodden down into their own blood stained soil the people of many a clime who had else dwelt in freedom i am no roman in this sense and ought never to have been admit that i am not justified in raising my hand against the life of a parent though if i could defend myself against violence no otherwise i should raise to approve and second with my best blood all the acts of my country but when she errs am bound on the other hand to blame and if need be oppose why not what is this country men like myself who enact the decrees by which i am to be thus bound senators no more profoundly wise perhaps and no more irreproachably virtuous than myself and do i owe their judgments a dearer allegiance and which i esteem false than i do to my own which i esteem right and true never such patriotism is a degradation and a vice rome lucius i think to have dealt by me and the miserable men who with me fell into the hands of sapor after the manner of a selfish cold hearted unnatural parent and i renounce her and allegiance to her i am from this hour a palmyrene zenobia is my mother palmyra my country but distinction be made between your country and her emperor is the country to rest under the imputation which is justly perhaps cast upon its men that were hardly right to renounce gallienus were he now emperor were a defensible act but why rome or aurelian i freely grant that had a just emperor been upon the throne a man with human feelings the people had he projected our rescue or revenge would have gone with him but how is their conduct to be defended during the long reign of the son of valerian was such a people as the people of rome to conform their minds and acts to a monster like him was that the part of a great nation is it credible that the senate and the people together had no power to compel gallienus to the performance of his duties to his own father and the brave legions who fell with him alas they too wanted the will oh not the death or the captivity of his father that he might reign to release him was the last act that wretch could have been urged to do and could he then have been made to interpose for the others he might have been assassinated but all the power of rome could not have compelled him to a war the issue of which might have been by the rescue of valerian to lose him his throne then he should have been assassinated rome owed herself a greater duty than allegiance to a beast in human form but calpurnius you are now at liberty why consider so curiously whence it comes besides you have while in persia dwelt in comfort and at last even in magnificence the prince himself has been your companion and friend what was it he replied what was it when i reflected upon myself but so much deeper degradation to find that in spite of myself persian effeminacy what was it but the worst wretchedness of all to feel as i did that i a roman and a piso was losing my nature as i had lost my country if any thing seemed to turn my blood into one hot current of bitterness and revenge it was this it will never cool till i find myself sword in hand under the banners of zenobia urge me no more it were as hopeful an endeavor to stem the current of the euphrates as to turn me from my purpose i have reasoned with you because you are a brother not because you are a roman and i i replied can still love you because you are a brother nor less because you are also a palmyrene i greet you as the head of our house the elder heir of an illustrious name i still will hope that when these troubles cease rome may claim you as her own no emperor i fear would permit a renegade of such rank ever to dwell within the walls of rome let me rather hope that when this war is ended portia may exchange rome for palmyra and that here upon this fair and neutral ground the pisos may once more dwell beneath the same roof may it be so said gracchus and let not the heats of political opposition change the kindly current of your blood or inflame it you lucius piso are to remember the provocations of calpurnius and are to feel that there was a nobleness in that sensibility to a declension into persian effeminacy that to say the least reflects quite as much honor upon the name of piso and even roman as any loyalty to an emperor like gallienus or that
infamy are staining the honour of his high name still the being i loved before is the same to me as then and though his destiny is changed and his path is now amid scenes of tumult and blood still mother to share that destiny to be the flower on that path seems to me as precious a lot as ever ah and a thousand times more precious than when all else was bright around him but believe me my daughter did everard truly love you or were his affection for you any but a selfish principle he would not ask or wish you to make him happy at the sacrifice of all else that is dear to you there dear mother when everard and i last parted t was in bitterness i do not mean the day my father forbade him the dwelling i ve met him once since then though i did not tell you of the interview because his name was a painful word between us i met him with catharine by the hemlock spring and then he besought me to go home with him to england and told me how happy he could make me there with his gentle mother and his fair young sisters i spoke of you and of my father s anger heaven knows unkindness was farthest from me but his high spirit had been deeply wounded and his feelings had grown strangely sensitive he construed my looks and language into coldness at his altered fortunes oh how wrongfully and his proud spirit grew stern and with cold and haughty words we parted i ve never seen him since that hour you know we heard he hurried to quebec and then that there but from that hour no word hath passed between us till last evening last evening a stranger a soldier i doubt not from the camp above brought me a message from him it was only a ring that i had given him for this and a few hasty words written within the envelope and what were they helen said the mother calmly for the young lady had paused a moment as if waiting for the inquiry the purport of them was that as i had doubtless bestowed elsewhere the affections i had withdrawn from him it were better that the token should go with them also but he prayed that i would still deign to wear the other as the memorial of a heart that was irrevocably given and even he added could it be withdrawn thus lightly it were but an idle appendage to one who could bestow nothing with it but blighted fortunes his home too was henceforth in the field well was a thing too delicate for such a soil i sent him back the ring dear mother and with it the assurance that affections strong enough to endure cold and wrongful words could flourish amidst strife and danger as well as by a fireside home and love that had lived through slight and scorn was none too delicate for blighted fortunes and it would be because he himself had grown weary of his promises if helen gray was not his bride to morrow and i promised mother at all hazards i promised to await him here this day so the blame is all mine the sacrifice is voluntary and i am not alone in it dear mother you know that even in that very camp are females high born and beautiful who have forsaken all and come over the blue waters to a land of strangers and enemies to share the toils and dangers of the camp with those they love and were i less devoted i were unworthy a loud quick voice was now heard without and the next moment catharine gray rushed eagerly in now mother do you know that the army are already beyond the river and every wagon is at this moment in the square but ours helen gray she continued retreating with amazement as her eye just then fell upon her sister s dishabille are you bent upon our ruin and your own are you utterly distracted sister no catharine replied mrs gray suddenly rising and drawing the arm of her younger daughter in hers not distracted catharine but better far better that she were than thus to sin against the reason that god hath given her to him and to her own soul must helen gray answer for the hearts that she hath this day made broken and desolate what is it what can it mean exclaimed catharine in astonishment and vainly seeking to read the expression of her sister ay catharine continued mrs gray here s heavy news for your young heart your sister there in yonder recess your eldest your kind and loving sister hath given you and me and all of us up forever heavy news for you and heavier still for your father children she continued glancing at the little faces that were peeping in at the door drawn thither by the loud exclamations of catharine your sister helen is going away from us and you ll never see her again helen said mrs gray who had just returned and she spoke with an air so calm it seemed almost coldness at that fearful moment i ve persuaded hannah to remain here and accompany you to the camp i need not ask you to make her safety dear to you as your own and now helen farewell she continued turning to the door and her eye carefully avoiding her live but a little longer in this unloving world there will come an hour when you will mourn for the deep love you have this day flung from you farewell helen but then she paused and the rushing tears dimed her sight the parting words that tremble on the lip are but a cold unmeaning ceremony to the eye s farewell that one last look hurrying forth
city is near us in the palace upon the palatine but when he is here it is more remote in the enchanted gardens of sallust this spot first ennobled by and eye of taste the chief beauties of the scene are to be traced then afterward selected by vespasian as an imperial villa is now lately become the chosen retreat of aurelian it has indeed lost a part of its charms since it has been embraced by the extension of the new walls within the limits of the city but enough remain to justify abundantly the preference of a line of emperors it is there that we see livia most as we have been used to do and where are forcibly brought to our minds the hours passed by us so instructively in the gardens of zenobia often aurelian is of our company and throws the light of his strong intellect upon whatever subject it is we discuss he can not however on such occasions thoroughly tame to the tone of gentle society his imperious and almost rude nature the peasant of pannonia will sometimes break through and usurp the place of emperor but it is only for a moment for it is amusing to himself when with more grace than one would look for he acknowledges his fault ascribing it sportively to the fogs of the german marshes it amuses us to observe the power which the polished manners and courtly ways of livia exercise over aurelian whose ambition seems now as violently bent upon subduing the world by the displays of taste grace and magnificence as it once was to do it and is still indeed by force of arms having astonished mankind in one way he would astonish them again in quite another and to this later task his whole nature is consecrated with as entire a devotion as ever it was to the other livia is in all these things his model and guide and never did soldier learn to catch from the least motion or sign of the general his will than does he to the same end study the countenance and the voice of the empress yet is there as you will believe knowing the mean nor servile in this he is ever himself and beneath this transparent surface artificially assumed you behold feature for feature the lineaments of the fierce soldier glaring forth in all their native wildness and ferocity yet we are happy that there exists any charm potent enough to calm but for hours or days a nature so stern and cruel as to cause perpetual fears for the violences in which at any moment it may break out the late slaughter in the very streets of rome when the coelian ran with the blood of fifteen thousand romans butchered within sight of their own homes with the succeeding executions naturally fill us with apprehensions for the future we call him generous and magnanimous and so he is compared with former tyrants who have polluted the throne tiberius commodus or maximin but what title has he to that praise when tried by the standard which our own reason supplies of those great virtues i confess it was not always of justice it was indignation at crime or baseness which sometimes brought upon him the charge of cruelty never the wanton infliction of suffering and death but it certainly is not so now a slight cause now rouses his sleeping passions to a sudden fury often fatal to the first object that comes in his way but enough of this do not forget to tell me again of the old hermit of the mountains and that you have visited him if indeed he be yet among the living even with your lively imagination fausta you can hardly form an idea of the sensation which my open assertion of christian principles and assumption of the christian name has made in rome i intended when i sat down to speak only of this but see how i have been led away my letters will be for the most part confined i fear to the subjects which engross both myself and julia most such as relate to the condition and prospects of the new religion which is going on not that i shall be speechless upon other and inferior topics but that upon this of christianity i shall be garrulous and overflowing i believe that in doing this i shall consult your preferences as well as my own i know you to be desirous of principles better than any which as yet you have been able to discover and that you will gladly learn whatever i may have it in my power to teach you from this quarter but all the teaching i shall attempt will be to narrate events as they occur and state facts as they arise and leave them to make what impression they may when i just spoke of the sensation which my adoption of the christian system had caused in rome i did not mean to convey any idea like this that it has been rare for the intelligent and cultivated to attach themselves to this despised religion on the contrary it would be true were i to say that they who accept christianity are and they rank far above the lowest it is not the dregs of a people who become reformers of philosophy or religion who grow dissatisfied with ancient opinions upon exalted subjects and search about for better and adopt them the processes involved in this change in their very nature require intelligence and imply a character of more than common elevation it is neither the lowest nor the highest who commence and at first carry on a work like this but those who fill the intermediate spaces the lowest are dead as brute matter to such interests the highest the rich the fashionable the noble from opposite causes just as dead or if they are alive
not a little and drawn from him the explanation that it was an old friend of his who had gone to davy jones long before it produced a somewhat similar effect upon him on the present occasion and he muttered ay i knows him it looks just like him when but he interrupted himself i knows him he repeated poor gentleman his name was mowbray aubrey aubrey cried the intendant with a smothered voice well it may be said brown but i always thought it was mowbray and sure his own brother the sodger told us so the skipper and me when he bought us mowbray and poor gentleman the hellcats whereof i mean the d d spanish constables were after him because how he was a traitor or conspirator or whatsoever you call it and so we sent the boat and took him off by night him and the rest of them and a whole chestful of money and off went the sally ann a bragging through blue water off she went and split me the blue water soon had the best of her she foundered please your honour s excellency and the skipper and the passengers with poor mr aubrey if so be that s his name went down with her to the bottom my miserable brother cried the intendant covering his face with his hands and sinking into a chair but starting up again he demanded but how is this you were saved others were saved none but me and tim aubrey eagerly demanded turning to me what was not that the name of the fellow the captain of the sloop just before us this question which i answered in the affirmative not without alarm lest duck should be sent for and immediately impeach my honest acquaintance had the effect of disturbing the latter likewise so that forgetting his former assurance that he knew no spanish he hastened to exclaim there s more ducks than swim on salt water but this here fellow ca nt be tim duck because how davy jones has got him fortunately for brown the intendant was too much excited to notice the inconsistency and brown to secure his attention to less dangerous subjects immediately resumed his story none but me and tim duck said he stood it out because how d ye see we took to the boat the three men and me which was the mate and which jumped after us and that was all of us when we pushed off what then cried colonel aubrey my poor brother was abandoned without an effort to save him why d ye see quoth brown he would run below after the younker and just then the schooner took a lurch and so we pushed off and down she went with him and the skipper too for blast me he was lying sick in his bunk unable to help himself and so we pushed off in the boat without bread water or compass and pitch d about fourteen days on a stretch and two of the men they died and says i to tim duck says i tim duck we must draw lots and says he to me let s do for the niggur and so he killed the blacky and we lived on him six days boston and pick d us up and there shiver my timbers your honour and excellency there s the end of the story it is not yet the end of it said colonel aubrey with a stern voice it is now seventeen years since that vessel sailed out of her port never more to enter another and up to this moment not a word of her fate was ever breathed to human being and no one but believed she had foundered at sea and that every soul on board had perished with her how comes it that neither you nor the fellow duck the survivors of the wreck ever gave information of the calamity to any one to owners or underwriters how could this have happened if your story be true and by heaven your silence throws a suspicious character over what was before only deemed a natural accident of the sea speak fellow though you pretend to have forgotten me there were persons who said the mate of the sally ann had not always been in so honest a vessel and was not the safest man to entrust with either a rich cargo or the life of a wealthy passenger they lied then d n their blood cried brown with great emphasis for the mate of the sally ann was as honest a lad at her sailing as ever rose from the forecastle to the quarter deck and if you re the gentleman poor mr mowbray s brother whereof i disremember who made the bargain with the skipper and me and brought him and the younker and the young niggur and the money aboard you must know the old skipper said i was to have the schooner next voyage blast her because how he was the owner and he was old and he knew i was a man to be depended on and as for this here thing that surprises you your honour never heard tell of the sinking of the schooner till now why sink me that s matter soon settled for d ye see the ship that pick d up me and tim duck was the good hope of boston and she was an injieman on her outward voyage and so says captain jones her commander to us says he i ll send you back to the states by the first return ship we meets or i ll drop you at the cape but hang me there was no return ship we sees and when we comes to the cape there was nothing there and the good hope was short of hands because she lost four men overboard in a squall and says captain jones
though mistress saultz had been gone but a few minutes those minutes seemed to fitzvassal as many hours why can they delay so thought he in the misery of his impatience who are they inquired the dying woman stretching her pale emaciated fingers in the direction of the cellar door what do you mean my dear mother replied the son who are they there oh now i know look at them edward do you see them dearest mother ejaculated her son believing that her mind had wandered and that any further reference to the subject would add to her delirium they are beautiful and bright creatures see they are beckoning to me i will go with them but not quite yet edward my love are you here fitzvassal bowed his head upon his mother s bosom and wept like a child god unhappy man perceived a slight shuddering beneath him and he lifted his head to gaze on his mother s corpse he laid his hand upon her heart but it was still and quiet he lifted her arm and it fell from his grasp heavily and dead her eyes were fixed in their sockets and as he pressed the cold lids upon them there came no sign of life and he held his hand there till the current of his own life chilled and he thought of her seducer and his affections withered up while his heart for the moment overflowed with bitterness the bereaved son then knelt on the bare ground and poured forth an imprecation deep and earnest on that man who had given him life and been the means of destroying his mother and before he rose again he had sworn terribly that nothing should prevent that vengeance which the sacrifice before him demanded yes he exclaimed aloud by thy sainted spirit thou unheard of sufferings by thy pale lifeless body that now lies before me i swear that edmund vassal shall bitterly atone for this deed and he seated himself upon the side of the stiffened corpse and gave vent to his concentrated misery the cellar in which these sufferings were showed the very picture of penury the bare ground without one plank to keep off the dampness was its only floor and this so wet and muddy that the most robust health would have sunk under its influence there was no furniture there unless a couple of old packing boxes could be called such which served for a bedstead to keep the straw from the mud and another which was used for a table other than these there was nothing that could be called so the cellar door was much broken and the walls of which the apartment was made were so dilapidated that in the day time one could not well help seeing into the street such was the lived for months and where she now lay in cold obstruction dead to such a place it was provided that her miserable son should be led that he might take the blessing of his mother happy for him if his heart had been already softened by suffering to receive the imprint of that impression which her dying words should have made but unprepared for so great a calamity his heart rebelled against the ordinances of heaven and he cursed and bemoaned his fate as one which had been cruelly forced on him and which he believed he did not deserve mrs saultz and the boy willy now arrived with a basket containing such matters as was judged to be best for the poor woman whose sp
